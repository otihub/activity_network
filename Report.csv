The activity aims to support the work of the Constitutional Drafting Assembly (CDA) through hiring a technical advisor. The CDA advisor will provide daily monitoring of CDA sessions, provide administrative support for the Assembly’s headquarters, and hold regular meetings with key stakeholders. The technical advisor will report on the work of the CDA and sessions outcomes, liaise with Al-Bayda' based stakeholders and participants in the Libyan Constitutional process, provide technical and logistical support on the ground and provide recommendations of activities that can support the CDA activities. There has been a public and political push to finalize the content of the constitution in order to stabilize the transitional political period in Libya and the Constitution seems to be the only hope for the Libyans unity and country stability. The technical advisor will provide the LTI project recommendation of activities that can push this process forward and support the challenging political transition in the country. The CDA technical advisor’s role is fluid as is the situation in the country and might adapt as the CDA process evolves.

",Staying on Track: Supporting the Constitutional Drafting Assembly in Libya,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The anti-extremist Operation of Dignity in Benghazi in May, and the anti-secularist Operation of Dawn in Tripoli in July, are proof of a lack of strong governmental institutions. Despite this, the Libyan Government is moving forward with a constitutional drafting process that is widely respected by the public. There is a critical need to capitalize on this legitimacy and momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts.
After long delays and much uncertainty, the GNC decided on February 06, 2013 to hold popular elections for the Constitutional Drafting Assembly (CDA), tasked with authoring Libya’s post-revolution constitution. The 60- member committee is composed of 20 members from each of the nation’s three regions – East, West, and South. Six seats will be allocated for women, and three minority groups – Tuareg, Tebu, and Amazigh -- will each receive two seats. The High National Elections Committee (HNEC) was responsible for preparing the election, including voter registration, candidate registration, and developing the mechanisms to implement the election law. Elections were held February 20, 2014. Despite a low turnout, the CDA is regarded as one of the few legitimate and functioning government entities in this time of political and security uncertainty.
The CDA has made notable progress since those initial elections. It drafted its own initial internal laws,
approved a process for communicating with the public, and has created committees to deal with eight thematic aspects of the constitution. The CDA have created a sort of ‘constitutional map’ that defines sources, chapters, references, and the titles of the constitution. The CDA was able to maintain the s independence, which is of the utmost importance. On the other hand, major operations such as the Operations Dignity and Dawn pose challenges to the CDA’s work. As a result, the CDA has set new timelines – including having a draft published for public comment in December and a finalized version completed by March 2015. 
During this preparatory period, providing the CDA with the assistance they need and establishing a direct presence in Al Bayda' is of upmost important. Tracking the content of CDA sessions, decisions made, and disseminating that information to the public are critical to maintaining the public’s confidence in this process. Establishing day-to-day interaction with the CDA is essential for the LTI to be able to access information about the constitutional drafting, and develop needed programming concepts to support this process. In order to meet these objectives, LTI is seeking to hire an advisor, for a period of three months through the UNSMIL office to assist with priority interventions with both civil society and government counterparts in addition to report on the CDA activities and providing consultation when needed. This activity assumes that a comprehensive, inclusive, and effective constitutional drafting process will contribute to a successful and stable political transition in Libya. Additionally, it seeks to support the political will and public interest necessary to sustain the constitutional process.

The activity aims to support the Constitution Drafting Committee (CDA) by creating a rapid response support mechanism. This DDGS will provide material and logistical assistance for outreach activities; information outreach campaigns and other requests identified that support the work of the CDA and other key  stakeholders such as CSOs, NGOs or key individuals. There has been a political and community push for a comprehensive Constitution draft including key issues that support the political transition in the country in order reinvigorate the transition and form systems in the country. Those issues include the forms of the state, form and system of a government, Judiciary power and constitutional Court, Rights and Freedom and Transitional Court, Local governance, Army and Police, Financial system and natural resources and Independent constitutional bodies. The CDA is an important entity nowadays and the only hope for Libyans to generate positive momentum and change on the ground. In addition, the drafting of the constitution is still a fluid ongoing process that will enable LTI to quickly respond to requests from a variety of stakeholders across Libya.

",Stay on the Right Track with the Constitution: CDA Support Fund,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility  complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The start-up of the Operation of Dignity in Benghazi to fight extremism on May 12 and the Operation of Dawn lately in Tripoli between the Zintanis and Misratis are proof of a lack of strong governmental institutions. The Libyan Government decided on steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, conducting parliamentary elections in May 2014 and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly who is now working on meeting different groups in the country to engage them in drafting the constitution. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts.
 
After long delays and much uncertainty, the GNC decided on February 06, 2013 to hold popular elections for the committee that will draft Libya’s post-revolution constitution. The law to elect the committee was approved by the GNC on July 16, 2013. Under the election law, the 60-member committee will be composed of 20 members from each of the nation’s three regions – East, West, and South. Six seats will be allocated for women, and three minority groups – Tuareg, Tebu, and Amazigh -- will each receive two seats. The High National Elections Committee (HNEC) has been responsible for preparing the election, including voter registration, candidate registration, and developing the mechanisms to implement the election law. Elections were held February 20, 2014 with a low turnout of around 50% of initial registered candidates. This was mainly due security incidents, boycotts and general lack of interest.
On May 1, 2014, the CDA held a press conference with the aim to provide an update on the progress made by the CDA since April. Ali Tarhouni, CDA president announced that the CDA agreed upon rules and procedures that will direct their proceedings. Those include (1) the need to be inclusive and transparent regarding their work, (2) Conduct of public outreach in the election districts, and (3) Elections for CDA in Murzuk and Kufra to be held. The CDA is becoming a well-represented organization. On the other hand, as per the Lawyers for Justice in Libya (LFJL) there are major concerns to be able to have a national consent on a constitution when 20% of drafters are not part of the CDA due to boycotts and security incidents that took place during the elections of the CDA back in February.
The CDA had made progress as it drafted its own initial internal laws, approved a process for communicating with the public, and had created committees to deal with various aspects of the constitution. Foundations for the CDA has created a sort of ‘constitutional map’ that defines sources, chapters, references, and the titles of the constitution. The CDA was able to maintain the s independence, which is of the utmost importance. On the other hand, major operations such as the operation of dignity and dawn recently in Tripoli will provide challenging to finalize and present the first Constitution Draft to the HoR by December 24, 2014.
The CDA plans to hold a conference in October to discuss several substantive parts of the constitution that has been agreed on (Army and Police, Local Governance…).
This DDGS will create a flexible fund to rapidly respond to urgent requests to support the CDA with information dissemination, outreach events, meetings, or other activities that aim to engage civil society in this critical transition process. In recent weeks, LTI has received several requests from the International organizations to provide support, including hosting several workshops or supporting regional conferences to allow the CDA to come together and discuss major issues to be included in the constitution. In addition, LTI is planning on supporting an STTA expert based in Beida ( main location of CDA) to directly work with CDA, monitor its work and providing recommendations to facilitate the drafting of the constitution and information dissemination to the public.
This activity assumes that there will be sufficient political will and public interest to sustain the Constitutional process.""

LTI is supporting youth constructive engagement in civic life by improving their media skills and capabilities through the procurement of media equipment and training of 24 young media documenters from eastern Libya. Under the Gadhafi regime, freedom of expression was restricted unless it conformed to the regime doctrines. Even in post-revolution Libya, youth have limited opportunities and venues to express their views and aspirations. This activity will support Radio & Studio Qurayna, a youth ran broadcasting center that is supported and supervised by the network of local civil society organizations. The media documenters from across eastern Libya will create media content as regional correspondents for the media center in Shahat as well as assist local civil society organizations in their communities better implement outreach campaigns, advance their advocacy capabilities and improve their non-violent means of expression.

Libya’s post-revolution political transition has become derailed amid increasing violence. Voter turnout for legislative elections declined 20 per cent between 2012 and 2014, reflecting growing disaffection at the political process. In the east, Operation Dignity was launched in May 2014 to root out extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all-out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments have formed, in alignment with these precarious alliances. Each side has sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fuelling instability across Libya. This has created a conducive environment for criminals and extremists to recruit and operate. The country faces increasing polarization, including fears that it could split along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.
Eastern Libya was the birthplace of the 2011 revolution and has since become a symbol of the transition’s struggles. Islamic extremist groups have taken control in the town of Derna, declaring allegiance to international franchises like al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Ansar Al Sharia is vying for control of Benghazi, the region’s capital. Following almost two years of political assassinations and declining government control in Benghazi, veteran military commander Khalifa Heftar launched Operation Dignity in May 2014 with the support of units of the Libyan National Army (LNA) and the local population. The fight for Benghazi has become protracted and entangled with the wider Dawn-Dignity struggle. National government institutions have withdrawn to the towns of Tobruk, al Bayda and Shahat where security is enforced by tight-knit tribal structures. The presence of government institutions in these towns, as well as the influx of displaced persons from Derna and Benghazi, now threatens to undermine their stability. The alliance of Heftar, the LNA, the House of Representatives (HOR) and its appointed government is both ill-defined and under strain. Its unraveling would complicate the fight against extremism.
LTI 2 is supporting youth constructive engagement in civic life by improving their media skills and capabilities. Digital media is an effective and speedy tool to raise public awareness, share information as well as build consensus amongst wider public dealing with some similar challenges and priorities. During the spring revolution of Libya, many youth in Benghazi worked with international correspondents covering the war gaining value film and photographic experience resulting later in youth producing short clips for social media and participating in Benghazi film festival in 2013. These activities encouraged the Ministry of Culture and Civil Society (MCCS) to make some contributions to the TV studio in Shahat and promises to further support youth in producing 42 short films but shifting government priorities annulled these plans. 
Under the Gadhafi regime, freedom of expression was restricted unless it conformed to the regime doctrines. Even in post-revolution Libya, youth outside  have limited opportunities and capabilities to express their views and aspirations - though Benghazi youth have had some notable achievements in this regard. LTI 2 is supporting this activity through the procurement of media equipment for TV Shahat Studio and training of 24 young media documenters from eastern Libya.  Given the success Benghazi youth have had with digital media, this activity will support Radio & Studio Qurayna, a youth ran broadcasting center that is supported and supervised by the local network of civil society organizations. Media documenters from across eastern Libya will provide media content as regional correspondents for the media center in Shahat that will raise public awareness, share information as well as build consensus as well as assist local civil society organizations in their communities better implement outreach campaigns, advance their advocacy capabilities and improve their non-violent means of expression.
The Radio & Studio Qurayna (RSQ) established in late 2011 by local high school and university student volunteers broadcasts daily radio programming and news for the Shahat region. The media youth enthusiast are mainly sponsored by the Media & Culture City Forum, a network of 60 local civil society organizations.  Although the radio activities are very successful, the TV media has had limited success due to limited technical equipment as well as number of content providers. Through this activity, the media documenters will provide a platform for communities to raise their voice on their challenges and aspirations creating understanding and addressing root causes of conflicts.
Assumption & Theory of Change statement: This activity assumes that youth who are involved in  activities in their communities are more likely to be engaged in the civic life or decision-making process.

This activity seeks to support youth in regular and constructive engagement in civic life by improving  Manga cartooning skills and capabilities of East Libyan youth so they can create a platform for regular media engagement with youth promoting messages of non-violence and peaceful development. Due to the presence of extremist groups in Benghazi, not only have youth lost the space and opportunities to express their views but leading youth advocates have left the city for fear for their lives. The grantee will be Creators, an active group engaged in motiving and encouraging youth to pursue and develop their talents that has produced a number of local outreach campaigns. The grantee will provide training for 22 young Benghazi residents in Manga cartooning and assist with the development and publication of a new Manga publication. Manga is popular amongst youth in Benghazi and is an effective platform to deliver messages of non-violence to youth who are detached on the social-political level and tend towards violence.

In order to promote peaceful solutions to these tensions, LTI 2 provides support to advocates of dialogue and non-violence to collaborate, debate and build consensus. The Arts provide space where language, ideas, and conventions are examined, reshaped, and refined. Under the Gadhafi regime, freedom of expression was restricted unless it conformed to the regime doctrines. While now liberated, Libyan youth still have limited opportunities and venues to express their views and aspirations as well as addressing their daily challenges.
Creators is a small group of active youth whose objectives are to encourage Libyan youth to pursue, develop and display their talents, through their implementation of a simple process to develop ideas into practical activities that engage with audiences in Benghazi. The group consists of six permanent members who come together regularly to develop social campaigns by conducting brainstorm sessions, sketching designs and developing implementation plans using social media to reach out to their intended beneficiaries. Their most recent works “People Talk” depicts a young female model handcuffed with sticky notes saying “Loser”, “Fake”, “No”, etc. raising awareness on how society hinders girls and women from perusing their interests or even public activities. Another campaign “World Cup Faces” consisting of 32 photos of world cup participating nation flags painted on youth faces was aired on BEIN (the World Cup exclusive TV broadcaster) revealing to the world Libyan youth engagement with global competition.
LTI 2 is supporting Creators to implement a Manga trainings workshop and to launch for the first time in Benghazi four monthly Manga magazine issues to support the improvement of civic skills and capacity of youth in Benghazi to constructively engage with each other. Since no previous effort were made to launch a Manga magazine in Benghazi, this activity will build the capacity of 22 Manga youth enthusiasts creating space and engagement opportunities within their social groups. The Manga comics will address youth challenges as well as contain social and political responsible messages of non-violence and peaceful development. Youth will be invited to apply and be selected based on abilities and readiness to participate in this activity by Creators (grantee) an active group engaged in developing campaigns targeting audiences within Benghazi.
Manga is very popular amongst high school and university students as well as older groups due to the exposure youth have had starting in the eighties and onwards to Japanese amine cartoons (many based on Manga comics) on Libyan public television. More recently, in early 2000s Benghazi youth enjoyed Japanese Amine cartoons (also based Manga comics) such as One Piece, Naruto and Dragon Ball.  Today many youth follow Amine based on Manga comics by renting DVD from local distributors and on internet sites like http://mangastream.com/ as well as joining Facebook groups to comment on latest issues on pages like Anime Addition.

Media is an effective and speedy tool to raise public awareness, share information as well as build consensus amongst a wider public. Language, ideas, and conventions can be examined, reshaped, and refined. Under the Gadhafi regime, freedom of expression was restricted unless it conformed to the regime doctrines. While now liberated, Libyans across the country are overwhelmed by political and ideological media organizations promoting immoderate positions and agendas leaving the general public with limited choices promoting dialogue and peace. Through this activity LTI 2 will be promoting advocates for non-violence and dialogue communicate more effectively and audibly to a broader audience through the re-launching of a civil society newspaper that stopped publishing due to lack of financial funding. The only change will be to the name of the newspaper from Shams to al-Ruyeah (meaning the Vision); so as to avoid any copy right disputes between the grantee and Commission of Civil Society Bayda branch.
Shams newspaper was initially funded by the Commission of Civil Society Bayda branch (CCSB) with the aim to contribute to the advancement of Libyan public awareness of social responsibilities, democratic processes and active citizenship through its newspaper publication, seminars and workshops. In this activity the re-launched paper will be called al-Ruyeah. The group of novice writers who have worked on the old paper and planning to write for the newspaper have strong beliefs in Libya becoming a modern civil state. The previous Shams paper was supervised by some members of Omar Muktar University (founders of Shams Institute for Media & Culture (Shams)) some of whom completed their graduate studies in America.
The previous issues published by Shams newspaper have been widely accepted by citizens of Bayda cities. The newspaper covered a variety of civil society topics. For example, the newspaper raise awareness on the democratic processes, foundations and institutions with articles in focused on educating the Libyan public as well as informing them of the transitional process. The newspaper was very successful because it used to publish and addresses issues that are directly related and connected to people’s life. As part of the newspapers activities; monthly luncheon meetings with local community leaders and intellectuals took place to review, discuss and provide feedback on the current issue as well as make recommendation for the next monthly publication. On average 60 persons attended these meetings. Shams newspaper published eight monthly issues from January 2014 to August 2014 before financial difficulties forced the CCSB to withdraw its financial support. 
The target audience of the newspaper will be the local population of al-Jabal al-Akhdar as well as the cities of Benghazi and Tobruk; a major constituency in east Libya who have been overwhelmed by recent local media onslaughts promoting in some instances the splitting of the country. In turn the grantee seeks to advocate for a more reconciliatory approach and promote non-violent democratic processes to settle disputes both economic and ideological.
LTI 2 will strengthen voices for non-violence and dialogue by supporting advocates of peace and increase the number and spectrum of actors reaching a broader constituency. This activity will support the re-launching of Shams newspaper renamed al-Ruyeah, a Bayda civil society monthly newspaper and moderate voice allowing civil society organizations a platform for collaboration opportunities and consensus building. LTI will procure for Shams Institute for Media & Culture (Shams) office equipment, office space and materials, advertising costs as well as support the publication and distribution costs for four months.

This activity aims to promote a voices for non-violence and dialogue through increasing the effectiveness of the Benghazi LRC to pro-actively respond to community needs in Libya. Benghazi, one of the most conflict-impacted cities in Libya, has struggled with months of fighting between extremist militias and government forces, a lack of service delivery from the government and the absence of international organizations to provide direct support on the ground. As a result, the organizations still serving vulnerable local populations are stretched and their resources are depleted. While most of the national organizations suspended their work in Benghazi due to insecurity. Despite these challenges, the Benghazi LRC, a local organization affiliated with ICRC and active since 1963, has remained active, neutral and has promoted the peaceful co-existence between Libyans by providing emergency services to all parties. This grant will provide support to the Benghazi LRC by procuring 1000 emergency beds and bedding sets, over 200 emergency-responder vests and pants, and five generators, to effectively respond to community needs. Their work seeks to mitigate further conflict driven by precipitation of grievances and neglect among community in eastern Libya. Additionally, it sends a critical message that to the people of Eastern Libya that CSOs are becoming active again in Benghazi, signalling a return to post-conflict normalcy and civic engagement.

Eastern Libya was the birthplace of the 2011 revolution and has since become a symbol of the transition’s struggles. Islamic extremist groups have taken control in the town of Derna, declaring allegiance to international franchises like al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Ansar Al Sharia is vying for control of Benghazi, the region’s capital. Following almost two years of political assassinations and declining government control in Benghazi, veteran military commander Khalifa Heftar launched Operation Dignity in May 2014 with the support of units of the Libyan National Army (LNA) and the local population. The fight for Benghazi has become protracted and entangled with the wider Dawn-Dignity struggle. National government institutions have withdrawn to the towns of Tobruk, al Bayda and Shahat where security is enforced by tight-knit tribal structures. The presence of government institutions in these towns, as well as the influx of displaced persons from Derna and Benghazi, now threatens to undermine their stability. The alliance of Heftar, the LNA, the House of Representatives (HOR) and its appointed government is both ill-defined and under strain. Its unraveling would complicate the fight against extremism.
Since the violence erupted in Benghazi, dozens of people have been injured, thousands have been displaced or trapped into their houses. Volunteers of Libyan Red Crescent have played a vital role in responding to this urgent crisis. Under the guidance and principles of impartiality, the LRC has provided services to vulnerable people, especially women and children, without distinguishing between their affiliations. LRC’s role has widely been recognized by the international organization, including the ICRC, and the organization has become a sources of pride to all Libyans. Providing psycho-social support, evacuating citizens form war zones, assisting with travels arrangements, organizing relief and arranging storage and participating in the distribution, the 790 volunteers of LRC have served many of the 750,00 population of Benghazi. Additionally, LRC volunteers are also organizing activities for displaced youth and children in parts of Benghazi where schools are still operating, as well as providing games to kids in public parks and setting football fields to create a space for youth and children to engage in positive activities under stressful environments.
Remarking on how effective local institutions an become in challenging situations like these, the head of LRC Kais Muftah stated that “We are so proud of our volunteers, who rushed to help injured people on the ground and in hospitals, and have provided psychosocial support by visiting hospitals and helping all those affected by this crisis."" Responding to the call of duty in hardship time, the organization has successfully evacuated more than 234 people, including 49 families and foreign workers to safe areas in Benghazi or neighborhood areas. 
In order to counter the impacts of local conflict, including the reduced spaces for CSOs engagement, LTI 2 supports local organizations to be effective and reach a broad audiences. This grant aims to support the Benghazi chapter of the LRC model a locally-based response to the needs of people in Benghazi. While, LRC has officially been part of the International Committee of the Red Crescent since 1958, the Benghazi chapter has a long-term, independent presence in Eastern Libya and is widely respected as a locally-relevant organization.
This activity assumes that by supporting the Benghazi LRC, other Eastern Libya community groups and CSOs will be encouraged to resume their activities because Benghazi is at a stage to regain stability in areas where the fighting stopped.

This activity aims to increase perceptions among Benghazi citizens in security, recovery and returning to normality by organizing advocacy campaign led by youth promoting good citizenship and respects for traffic rules and regulations in their communities. Increasing the number and attractiveness of opportunities for youth to engage in social and civic life will lead to improvements in sense of security measures in the city. LTI will support “Build my Country” Campaign procuring 5,000 booklets, 20 Billboards, 1,000 stick posters, 1000 T-shirts & hats and lunches for the campaign kickoff events as well as drinks for the awareness raising and distribution of booklets on roundabouts across Benghazi. After liberation in 2011, Benghazi was targeted by extremist militias who adopted a state of unrest, terrorized civilians and prevented key governmental services such as traffic police from doing their jobs. The International Libyan Organization for Culture and Peace (LOPC), an active youth organization who partnered with LTI in the past to implement an anti-weapon campaign (BENG052) to strengthen conflict management initiatives, is leading this activity with 100 volunteers encouraging youth to participate in issues that serve the inter-communal interests of Benghazi citizens. Youth representatives from other civil society organizations, Libyan Red Crescent, Ayadina and sports clubs from Benghazi will participate in this activity.

Theory of Change & Assumption Statement: If Libyan youth are provided alternatives to conflict and are given opportunities to engage in campaign that stress tolerance, good citizenship and peaceful co-existence than attitude will change overtime and they will seek peaceful ways to resolve disputes  and resist mobilization to conflict because the majority of Libyan youth are against being polarized and want to live in peace.
",Citizens Championing Traffic Laws,"
Libya’s post-revolution political transition has become derailed amid increasing violence. Voter turnout for legislative elections declined 20 per cent between 2012 and 2014, reflecting growing disaffection at the political process. In the east, Operation Dignity was launched in May 2014 to root out extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all-out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments have formed, in alignment with these precarious alliances. Each side has sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fueling instability across Libya. This has created a conducive environment for criminals and extremists to recruit and operate. The country faces increasing polarization, including fears that it could split along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.""
Eastern Libya was the birthplace of the 2011 revolution and has since become a symbol of the transition’s struggles. Extremist groups have taken control in the town of Derna. Following almost two years of political assassinations and declining government control in Benghazi with the destruction of all police stations and judiciary infrastructure, veteran military commander Khalifa Heftar launched Operation Dignity in May 2014 with the support of units of the Libyan National Army (LNA) and the local population. The fight for Benghazi has become protracted and entangled with the wider Dawn-Dignity struggle. National government institutions have withdrawn to the towns of Tobruk, al Bayda and Shahat where security is enforced by tight-knit tribal structures. The presence of government institutions in these towns, as well as the influx of displaced persons from Derna and Benghazi, now threatens to undermine their stability. The alliance of Heftar, the LNA, the House of Representatives (HOR) and its appointed government is both ill-defined and under strain. Its unraveling would complicate the fight against extremism.
After liberation in 2011, Benghazi was targeted by extremist militias who adopted a state of unrest, terrorized civilians and prevented key governmental services such as traffic police from doing their jobs. In order to mobilize the moderate middle, LTI 2 supports Libyan youth by increasing the number and attractiveness of opportunities for engagement in social and civic life. LTI 2 will support the International Libyan Organization for Culture and Peace (LOPC) in its implementation of the “Build My Nation” campaign to network with youth representatives from other civil society organizations such as the Libyan Red Crescent, Ayadina and sports clubs from Benghazi to have 100 volunteers participate in this activity.

This activity will foster public support for peace and national unity in Benghazi through popular music and music videos. This grant will re-establish the Benghazi Recording Studio and provide it with equipment and materials to produce eleven songs, three music videos, and two concerts in Benghazi. The activity will take place in Benghazi, a city in Eastern Libya that has witnessed violent conflict since May 2014 and in need of voices promoting peace and understanding among its polarized communities. The grant will be implemented by the Benghazi Recording Studio (BRS), a popular group in Benghazi that started small in 2011, then became very popular among youth. Their small studio, located at a co-founder’s residence, produced a lot of popular music in Benghazi during the revolution, while technically supporting many youth to record their music for free.

This activity assumes that re-establishing the Benghazi Recording Studio and providing it with equipment and materials to create and disseminate music focusing on themes of peace and national unity will foster public support for peace and national unity in Benghazi. This is because the lack of voices calling for peace and unified community have pushed community away from resorting to non-violence alternatives.

Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.

In order to promote peaceful solutions to these tensions, LTI 2 provides support to advocates of dialogue and non-violence to collaborate and expand their influence. Popular media is an effective and quick tool to raise public awareness, share information, and foster public support for ideas. Under the Gadhafi regime, freedom of expression was restricted unless it conformed to the regime doctrines. While the country is now liberated, Libyans across the country are overwhelmed by increasingly polarized media promoting immoderate positions and agendas, which further exacerbates conflict. Youth in particular - the majority of Libya's population - are vulnerable to polarized media propaganda, aggressive recruitment in to militias, and messages promoting violence. Yet, at the same time, they have played a central role in the 2011 revolution and have the potential to be the dynamo of Libya’s transition process through their creativity. This activity harnesses this positive energy from youth and creates opportunities for young advocates of non-violence and dialogue to reach a broader audience.
In this activity, LTI 2 is collaborating with a group of musicians to re-establish the Benghazi Recording Studio. The musicians are led by DJ ENZOO (Motaz Salama) and Ibn Thabit (Assem Mihirig), two artists who have contributed to many successful songs in Benghazi since the revolution and have a strong local following. The two artists met at a street concert organized by DJ ENZOO in 2012. The duo pooled their resources and established a soundproof recording studio on top of an apartment building to produce songs by emerging artists. Unfortunately, fighting in downtown Benghazi since the launch of Operation Dignity destroyed their rooftop studio. Thus, in this activity LTI 2 will revive the studio and support its work as a moderate voice for non-violence and dialogue in the East. LTI 2 will provide Benghazi Recording Studio with equipment and materials to produce eleven songs, three music videos, and two concerts in Benghazi. For the eleven songs, the studio will work with emerging and upcoming musicians to produce songs that promote peace and national unity and counter messages of violence and intolerance. Then, music videos will accompany three of the songs - two performed by musicians selected in collaboration with LTI 2 staff and one performed by a trio of singers from Libya’s three regions (East, West, and South).

Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition. Eastern Libya was the birthplace of the 2011 revolution and has since become a symbol of the transition’s struggles. Islamic extremist groups have taken control in the town of Derna, declaring allegiance to international franchises like al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Ansar Al Sharia is vying for control of Benghazi, the region’s capital. Following almost two years of political assassinations and declining government control in Benghazi, military commander Khalifa Haftar launched Operation Dignity in May 2014 with the support of units of the Libyan National Army (LNA) and elements of the local population. The fight for Benghazi has become protracted and entangled with the wider Dawn-Dignity struggle. National government institutions have withdrawn to the towns of Tobruk, al Bayda and Shahat where security is enforced by tight-knit tribal structures. The presence of government institutions in these towns, as well as the influx of displaced persons from Derna and Benghazi, now threatens to undermine their stability. The alliance of Haftar, the LNA, the House of Representatives (HOR) and its appointed government is both ill defined and under strain. Its unraveling would complicate the fight against extremism. 
In this environment, LTI 2 provides support to advocates of dialogue and non-violence to collaborate, debate and build consensus among the majority of Libyans who aspire to live in a stable and prosperous nation based inclusivity, consensus and representative government. Through this activity, LTI 2 is empowering CSOs members to network and advocate for peace in eastern Libya, providing strategic communication support  promote and catalyze civil society activity through the Tazirbu LTI Information Center. This center is supervised by the local network of CSOs (TCSON). Recently, TCSON participated in preparatory meetings with a local committee to present local views and opinions to CDA in Bayda. TCSON will utilize the Tazirbu LTI Information Center to host activities around English language training, computer skills, citizenship and advocacy training workshops, and in support of these efforts LTI will renew the 2-way VSAT internet service account. By allowing the center to remain connected and serve as a community resource that can be utilized by TCSON, the center will provide opportunities for CSOs members to get to know each other better and that will build their capacity to implement effective local advocacy campaigns. Many Libyans seek end to conflict and yearn for a nation built on institutions, but are confronted with national economic and ideological disputes covered by aggressive local media messaging that inflate the conflict.
Following the support to the TCSON to form the information center under BENG033, the chairman of TCSON, gathered Tazirbu community leaders (CSOs, Tribal, Municipal, journalism activists) to attend a meeting with CDA leadership to present Tazirbu Community aspirations of constitution. Following the CDA meeting, the chairman met with LTI to advocate on behalf of the center to have its internet subscription renewed, in the same way that the other LTI information centers created under LTI 1 had their accounts renewed under TRIP140. Wisam stressed the need for internet access for the local community as it is one of the few effective places for locals to communicate with the rest of country, allow people to gather accurate information on the national dialogue process, and connect with other actors promoting non-violent solutions.
Similar to the other information centers, Tazirbu has turned into a hotspot in the community for engagement in the political process. Many people in the community have turned to the center to use the internet, looking for information related to the political processes and interact with the wider Libyan community to determine their own future by direct involvement. Furthermore, the center has provided a variety of training to its members. Activities hosted by the Tazirbu LTI Information Center include:
1. From November 2014 to present the High Medical Vocation center uses Tazirbu LTI Information center every Saturday (covering costs of trainer) to provide computer training for 35 girls in the morning, and 20 boys in the evening sessions
2. Local Urban Ministry used Tazirbu LTI Information center in March 2015 to provide its employees MS Excel/Word training while covering costs of trainer
3. WAC intended to conduct trainings at Tazirbu LTI Information center and brought down books, guides and workshop material but Operation Dignity annulled these activities, however the group is looking to reschedule new activities and use the center.
4. Tazirbu Civil Society Organizations Network (TCSON) monitored both Tazirbu (Nov 2013) and Kufra (Oct 2014) municipal elections.
Given the CSO use and potential to facilitate future activities by and between positive actors in the community, it makes programmatic sense to provide the same support to the Tazirbu LTI Information Center as the other centers did under TRIP140 and renew the VSAT subscription.

Most recently and after months of intense fighting, several areas of Benghazi have witnessed a steady decrease in violent incidents and slow return to normalcy. In select neighborhoods, local authorities have restored basic public services, such as garbage collection and police-manned local checkpoints, and even reopened elementary university services to enable prospective graduates to complete their final exams. However, not all areas have seen the same rate of recovery and continue to experience frequent outbreaks of violence and general instability. 
In order to further unpack these trends and improve program’s understanding of the factors and dynamics that have contributed to and support the renewed sense of stability, LTI 2 will partner with IAS, an experienced research company, to conduct a qualitative assessment and analysis project in Benghazi and the surrounding areas.  The project is expected to provide a basic understanding of stability and security perceptions, identify specific drivers behind the improved stability and inform future program design by testing key program assumptions. 
LTI 2 expects to use the results of the research to develop a more focused cluster of activities intended to leverage the current openings and reinforce positive trends in order to support target neighborhoods in their transition to stability and an acceptable degree of normality.
In this activity, IAS will use its research and analytical skills cultivated through years of work in fragile and conflict-affected areas as well as their robust networks in Eastern Libya, to organize focus groups and interviews primarily targeting youth in the areas of Kish, Fwayhat/Dubai Street, Ben Younes, Salmani and Birka, which are some of the most populated and stable areas in Benghazi at this moment, in order to identify key stability trends and dynamics.

Since the arrival of displaced families to Shahat eight months ago, tensions are rising as a result of fatigue on both the IDP and host communities because of numerous social and economic pressures, including higher prices for rent and consumer goods, as well as the use of schools and youth housing to host the IDPs. This grant aims to support interaction opportunities that increase positive understanding and solidarity between IDPs and host community members by stressing 1) equal status during interactions 2) inter-group cooperation, and 3) a common goal through a series of three types of competitions. The competitions will consist of chess contests, drawing competition, Arabis script writing, and trivia; teams will be structured so that they are mixed between IDP and host community youth. The events will take place over 2 weeks, beginning on/about July 5 and be broadcast on Radio Qurayna to convey the collaborative efforts and community solidarity to the wider community. This activity will be led by Shahat network of civil society and the crisis committee both of which will reach out to and mobilize participants from both IDP and host-community families.
","
Supporting positive interaction opportunities between IDPs and host community members through the organizing and broadcasting of the competitions and events will build a sense of solidarity, understanding, and shared condition between communities that will enhance perceptions of social stability to the general public. This assumes that a key cause of tension between IDP and host communities is a lack of opportunity for social interaction between them.
",Competing for Solidarity,"
Libya’s post-revolution political transition has become derailed amid increasing violence. Voter turnout for legislative elections declined 20 percentage points between 2012 and 2014, reflecting growing disaffection at the political process. In the east, Operation Dignity was launched by the LNA in May 2014 to confront extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments have formed, in alignment with these precarious alliances. Each side has sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fueling instability across Libya. This has created a conducive environment for criminals and extremists to recruit and operate. The country faces increasing polarization, including fears that it could split along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.
Eastern Libya was the birthplace of the 2011 revolution and has since become a symbol of the transition’s struggles. Islamic extremist groups have taken control in the town of Derna, with some declaring allegiance to al Qaeda and other to the Islamic State. Ansar Al Sharia is vying for control of Benghazi, the region’s capital. Following almost two years of political assassinations and declining government control in Benghazi, military commander Khalifa Haftar launched Operation Dignity in May 2014 with the support of units of the Libyan National Army (LNA) and local recruits. The fight for Benghazi has become protracted and entangled with the wider Dawn-Dignity struggle. National government institutions have withdrawn to the towns of Tobruk, al Bayda and Shahhat where security is enforced by tight-knit tribal structures. The presence of government institutions in these towns, as well as the influx of displaced persons from Derna and Benghazi, now threatens to undermine their stability. The alliance of Haftar, the LNA, the House of Representatives (HOR) and its appointed government is both ill defined and under strain. Its unraveling would further destabilize Eastern Libya and create a more conducive environment for extremist groups to exert their influence.  
It has been eight months since over a 1000 displaced families from Benghazi have settled in the city of Shahat. Although the community has thus-far absorbed the additional population, tensions between the displaced families and the host-community are increasing as a result of fatigue on both communities from higher prices for rent and consumer goods, and the overcrowding of public and private services. To counter this increase in tension, which could trigger instability in one of the last havens of relative safety in Eastern Libya, LTI intends to enhance social stability through the support of interaction opportunities that increase positive understanding and solidarity between internally displaced people (IDPs) and host community members in the region of Shahat and Bayda. LTI's cluster of activities supporting community solidarity and social cohesion are going to collectively try to stress 1) equal status during interactions 2) inter-group cooperation 3) common goal 4) leadership sanctioning and 5) sustained interaction.
The Shahat City Forum for Media & Culture (SCFMC) will lead this activity in collaboration with the Shahat Crisis Committee, established by the Shahat municipal council, and City Coordination Society. The SCFMC center, established during the 2011 revolution to support CSOs in Shahat, is the location for (1) LTI Shahat Information Center (BENG039), (2) Radio & Studio Qurayna (RSQ) established in late 2011 by local student volunteers to broadcast daily radio news programming (now receiving support under BEN003) and (3) the administration capabilities for numerous civil society organizations in region. The City Coordination Society, established in 2008, is the oldest CSO in Shahat. They do work ranging from cleanup campaigns, to historical site protection, to humanitarian activities during the 2011 revolution between Benghazi and Sirte and now the IDP crisis in Shahat. The Shahat Crisis Committee was established by the municipal council to manage and coordinate the efforts to house and support displaced families arriving in Shahat from Benghazi and Derna. Roughly 1200 displaced families  from Benghazi and Derna are presently residing in public schools, and youth housing while others rent in Shahat. An estimated 500 low income families are receiving direct support from City Coordination Society. 
Through this activity LTI 2 will support platforms for engagement between the IDP and host community members through the SCFMC center to collaborate with one another, displaying positive symbols of solidarity to the wider community. LTI 2 will provide stationary, snacks/coffee/drinks, small expendable items and prizes for the various competitions. This event is meant to provide food as well for community meals to encourage members of the general public and community to attend; the grantee and municipal council have agreed to contribute food for each of the events in order to get support from LTI to provide some key equipment for the venue cafeteria to function properly as a public community resource. The SCFMC center, which will host the competitions and events, will send official letters to all CSOs registered within the Shahat municipality, including sports clubs, to ask them to reach out to members of both IDP and host communities in order to form the mixed teams. While the competition will be for youth ages 6-16, parents, family members, friends, and members of the community will be encourage to attend and support the event, allowing for additional opportunities for positive interactions between people from different communities. At the end of the competitions, the grantee will bring IDP and host community participants and their families to the SCFMC for a final event, community meal and ceremony to the distribution prizes. Participants and their families will be asked to sit with their respective team members.

The grant seeks to increase interaction between Al Bayda municipal council and community through installation of a playground and an outreach campaign. Located between Benghazi and Derna, Al Bayda is the second largest town in Eastern Libya. With the national-level peace process faltering, local actors, including municipal councils, have emerged as the only functional and legitimate government authorities in Libya. Al Bayda municipal council enjoys relatively high support of the residents mostly owing to its ability to continue delivering basic services and effectively fill the governance vacuum created by the collapse of the state-level government. This activity will enable the council to deliver a popular community improvement project and create further opportunities for consultations with constituents through an opening ceremony, promotional materials and a public gathering to include residents and media. This initiative, implemented in partnership with International Republican Institute (IRI), will contribute to efforts to increase participatory local governance. 


","
If we assist Al Bayda municipal council with the delivery of a community improvement project and public outreach assistance, then we will increase the interaction between the council and the residents, because:
•	Municipal council is willing to interact with residents and sees value in better communication
•	Al Bayda residents want to have opportunities to communicate with the council
•	A tangible and popular project is an effective way for municipal council to engage residents and begin communicating

Each side sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fueling instability across Libya. More recently, conflict fatigue has set it in, prompting popular calls for peace, while local reconciliations have proliferated across the West. Warring Libyan factions signed UN-brokered peace agreement in Morocco in December 2015, but powerful spoilers remain outside of the agreement, making the immediate future unclear.
Following the bifurcation of Libya’s national legislative and executive branches in 2014, the country’s municipal councils, established a year earlier, remain as its most legitimate democratic authority. According to LTI-sponsored research under TRIP134 in Tripoli – and other independent research shows similar trend - 72 per cent of respondents perceived the councils as having a great deal or fair amount of legitimacy, significantly higher than either of the national legislatures. However, following the slowdown and eventual halt in the disbursal of national revenues as a result of the conflict, the municipal councils currently lack resources to exercise their authority and establish credibility among their constituents. The TRIP134 survey recorded that only 1 per cent of respondents perceived the councils to wield the most authority in Libya’s capital. Bridging the yawning gap between the legitimacy and authority of the municipal councils will help to establish the citizen-state relationship and invigorate waning public support for Libya’s democratic transition.
With intention to support this process, LTI2 is assisting municipal councils in 12 towns across Libya in implementing tangible community engagement projects - the multi-functional playgrounds for children and youth – and an outreach campaign to encourage greater civic participation in the work of the council and build public confidence in local government. By bringing together local authorities, civil society, and community members to deliver practical projects, these activities aim to build relationships among key stakeholders and bolster the visibility and legitimacy of municipal councils in their areas. 
As a part of this programming cluster, LTI2 will partner with International Republican Institute (IRI) to provide Al Bayda municipal council with the installation of a playground and an outreach campaign. Located between Benghazi and Derna, Al Bayda is the second largest city in Eastern Libya. Al Bayda municipal council was elected in 2014 and it has seven permanent members, including one woman. It is among the more trusted councils in this part of the country and it enjoys broad popular support, mostly owing to the fact that it includes representation from all key tribes from the area. While the council is struggling to secure steady resources, it has been nevertheless very effective in finding ways to access funds at the national level and maintain provision of basic public services even after the near-collapse of the state-level institutions. While the councils in other towns in the East, most notably the neighboring Benghazi, have not been able to deliver even rudimentary support to the residents, Al Bayda community enjoys regular garbage collection, relatively more stable supply of electricity and other public services. 
This activity will enable the Al Bayda municipal council to deliver a popular community improvement project and create further opportunities for consultations with constituents through an opening ceremony, promotional materials and a public gathering to include residents and media. The park, once a popular gathering place for the communities, fell into disrepair and closed after the revolution. Keen to reinvigorate this area, the council will contribute storage and security for the equipment for the duration of the project, and further assistance, including the clean up, electric lighting, repairs of the existing equipment and a coffee shop that are a part of the larger area.

The grant will support the installation of one playground set in Shahat and a campaign to promote the work of the municipal council and encourage greater community engagement. The objective of this effort is to strengthen the credibility of local municipal government among the public by assisting it in providing tangible community engagement project and developing interaction opportunities. In addition to boosting government legitimacy, the activity will create space for greater inter-group contact and help strengthen social trust, which has been weakened as a result of the decades of Gadhafi rule and subsequent political conflict. In this program cluster, LTI2 will directly partner with the Shahat municipal council, while IRI will provide complementary capacity building and mentoring throughout the process.

These activities assume that the ability of municipal councils to mobilize local residents and deliver highly visible community-engagement projects would strengthen their legitimacy among citizens and enable them to play more vital role in the governance process at the local level.

In this activity, LTI2 will support the installation of a community playground in Shahat’s central Martyr’s Square and an accompanying public outreach campaign. Although Shahat has been seen as a haven of relative safety in Eastern Libya, the influx of over 1,000 displaced families from Benghazi has disrupted the local dynamics. Although the community has thus-far absorbed the additional population, tensions between the displaced families and the host-community are rising as a result of the increasing costs of rent and consumer goods and the overcrowding of public and private services. 

Despite the pressures caused by the arrival of IDPs and the crisis of the national government institutions, the municipal council in Shahat has become more relevant and has continued to function.

Eastern Libya was the birthplace of the 2011 revolution and has since become a symbol of the transition’s struggles. Extremist groups have taken control in the town of Derna. Following almost two years of political assassinations and declining government control in Benghazi with the destruction of all police stations and judiciary infrastructure, veteran military commander Khalifa Heftar launched Operation Dignity in May 2014 with the support of units of the Libyan National Army (LNA) and the local population. The fight for Benghazi has become protracted and entangled with the wider Dawn-Dignity struggle. National government institutions have withdrawn to the towns of Tobruk, al Bayda and Shahat where security is enforced by tight-knit tribal structures.

The alliance of Heftar, the LNA, the House of Representatives (HOR) and its appointed government is both ill-defined and under strain. Its unraveling would complicate the fight against extremism.
Since the revolution, Libyans have stressed that a decline in community engagement and the lack of social spaces have been among the key factors preventing trust building and the nation from moving forward. Qaddafi did not allow for many social spaces for most of his rule and Libya has never been a nation, with communities divided before and during colonialism, a weak functioning state under the kingdom and divide-and-rule tactics under Qaddafi. The post-revolution inter-communal conflict only exacerbated the already low level of social trust, further threatening the peace and reconciliation efforts. Particularly at this key time in the building of the Libyan nation, people will need to come together in order to forge a common national identity. In addition to strengthening the Government of National Accord and local municipal councils, increasing social spaces for interaction and gatherings in priority communities are seen as an important contribution to the nation-building process.
In an effort to counter the sense of frayed social cohesion, LTI is implementing a cluster of visible, tangible community engagement projects that help to boost support for the local government and create space for inter-communal interaction. As a part of this programming cluster, LTI2 will partner with the famous Al Ahly Sports, Cultural and Social Club in Benghazi and support the installation of a multifunctional playground for children and youth and an event to bring the residents and children together for a day of fun and engaging activities. The activity will be supported by Benghazi municipal council and several civil society organizations and designed to support joint community investment and encourage greater public engagement. 
Al Ahly is perhaps best known in Libya for its hugely successful football club that won series of cups in 1980s and 19990s, but today, it serves as one of the most popular social outlets that organizes activities to bring together families, including children, youth and women, and provides a safe haven and a much needed break from the difficult economic and security situation in Benghazi. 
The key assumption behind this activity is that community spaces and engaging events would provide positive opportunities and encourage greater interaction between different communities, thereby helping to restore a sense of social trust and cohesion. This is because the lack of opportunities for interaction between different towns and communities in Libya has been a driver of conflict between them.

The activity seeks to increase interaction between Benghazi residents in Elkeesh and the Benghazi Municipal Council. To achieve this objective, LTI will support the Benghazi MC, cleaning company, and volunteers to conduct a 3-month cleanup and awareness campaign in Elkeesh area. Elkeesh area is one of the most populated areas in Benghazi with many of the main buildings and public spaces, and it suffers from widespread trash and rubble in these spaces. This highly visible public problem continues to undermine confidence in the MC – or perpetuate the belief that an MC does not even exist. LTI 2 will provide some equipment rental, basic supplies and material, stipend support, and awareness campaign support. Rugby 2018, leveraging, its unique relationship with the Benghazi MC, will provide manpower, coordination of volunteers, and behind the scenes logistical support. Benghazi MC will take the lead in information and awareness, educating the public about trash collection procedures going forward, and coordinating with the public cleaning company. This arrangement will maximize the opportunity for the Benghazi MC to interact with residents.

(b)   The clean up campaign will increase the awarness of the residents about the existence of the Benghazi MC. 

(c)    The trash problem in Elkeesh is the most highly visible public problem in the city and residents want to see a solution

(d)   Trash collection and cleaning of streets will assist in building confidence on MC and reflec the ability of the MC to provide services



(e)    In the campaign, the MC will be at the forefront of efforts to address this problem in Elkeesh. They will interact with volunteers and with residents through information campaign. This will create an opportunity for citizen-MC interaction around one of the MC’s core services. 
",Benghazi Cleanup Campaign,"
At the beginning of 2016, Libya’s political future is more uncertain than at any time since the 2011 revolution. Political division, armed conflict and a crisis of legitimacy at the national level have accelerated the fragmentation of Libya’s governance landscape. Regional coalitions which formed in 2014 have fractured during 2015 and cities and municipalities have become increasingly isolated. Libya’s two nominal national governments both exert little authority outside their respective bases in Tripoli and Tobruk. The political elites involved in the UN-sponsored dialogue to form a unity government lack legitimacy and the country lacks a national political leadership that can claim a mandate to negotiate a solution to Libya’s crises. The collapse of the national-level political process and institutions has shifted significant governance responsibilities to local formal and informal actors. Municipal councils are viewed as the most credible institutions, though they face serious challenges to providing services to their constituents. The collapse of state institutions and the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security vacuum to strengthen its presence in Libya.
In light of the political conflict and dysfunction plaguing the national level since 2014, the country’s municipal councils, established a year earlier, remain Libya's most legitimate democratic authority. According to LTI 2-sponsored research with Altai, a wide majority of Libyans have a positive perception of the role of the municipal councils. In Tripoli specifically, LTI 2 found in 2015 that 72 per cent of respondents perceived the councils as having a great deal or fair amount of legitimacy, significantly higher than any national institution. However, given problems in the disbursal of national revenues as a result of the conflict in Libya, the municipal councils currently lack resources to exercise their authority, communicate effectively, and establish credibility among their constituents. 
Since it was elected the Benghazi Municipal Council has suffered from a lack of funding, which hindered its ability to provide full services to the community. Even for services like basic clean up and trash collection, the MC is unable to adequately provide services. The public cleaning company under the Ministry of Environment continues to provide some basic trash collection. However, the MC does not have the resources or equipment to clean up large piles of trash and rubble in public areas and streets. Many residents are also not aware of procedures for trash collection, which exacerbates the problem. This problem is particularly bad in Elkeesh in the center of Benghazi with a large population of citizens and IDPs and most of the main buildings and public spaces in the city. Thus, citizens do not have any confidence in the MC’s ability to provide services. Moreover, many residents are not aware that the MC even exists and are clueless about its roles and responsibilities.
To help the MC address these issues, LTI 2 will support a three-month long cleanup and community awareness campaign in Elkeesh area in cooperation with the MC and Rugby 2018. This effort will mobilize around 150 volunteers from civil society organizations to clean up the streets and public areas in Elkeesh. Volunteers (coordinated by Rugby 2018) will work in coordination with the MC and the cleaning company to clean trash and rubble from these areas and paint and rehabilitate some of the public spaces. LTI 2 will provide basic supplies for these efforts, renting of equipment to help the cleaning company with this major “push,” and stipends to organizers of the effort. In addition, LTI, the MC, and the grantee will conduct an awareness campaign that informs residents about what the MC is doing and educates people about proper trash disposal.

For the last few months, Rugby 2018 has led a successful initiative that provides capacity building and service delivery support to the Benghazi MC, including on-the-job training, leadership skills course for 15 offices of the Benghazi MC, and support to provide electricity to the city in cooperation with MC with Sadim and Aljeel power companies. Their role in this campaign is to provide manpower/volunteers, logistical support, and overall coordination. These are the “behind the scenes” functions where the MC needs the most support. The MC will take the lead in public events related to the campaign (including working with volunteers), information and awareness, and coordination with the cleaning company and national level authorities. This arrangement will facilitate the basic interaction that still needs to happen between citizens and the MC, as the MC works to establish its legitimacy and capacity in Benghazi.

(b) SMC wants to deliver basic services and to address community needs. 

(c) The trash problem is the most highly visible public problem in the city (many public demonstrations and MC directly asking for help)

(d) Benghazi residents care about the image of their city and they will participate in the clean-up campaign.

According to recent LTI 2-sponsored research with Altai, a wide majority of Libyans have a positive perception of the role of the municipal councils. In Tripoli specifically, LTI 2 found in 2015 that 72 per cent of respondents perceived the councils as having a great deal or fair amount of legitimacy, significantly higher than any national institution. However, since these institutions are such a new concept in Libya, most Libyans lack a basic understand of the roles and responsibilities of the municipal councils and how constituents should engage with them. Moreover, given problems in the disbursal of national revenues as a result of the conflict in Libya, the municipal councils currently lack resources to exercise their authority, communicate effectively, and establish credibility among their constituents, leading to a decreasing trust of MCs, after an initial wave of hope that the country finally had some form of legitimate governance. Thus, with the goal of increasing confidence in local governance, LTI 2 is assisting several key municipal councils across Libya to better provide basic services and engage with residents, the two main drivers of trust based on our research findings. 
Recently, the Shahat Municipal Council has suffered from a lack of funding from the national level, which hindered its ability to provide full services to the community. In contrast to nearby Bayda, which can more easily collect resources from businesses and shops, Shahat is smaller with more poverty. Even for services like basic clean up and trash collection, the MC is unable to adequately provide services. In February, residents organized major demonstrations in the streets to protest the lack of basic services and infrastructure maintenance, such as trash collection and clean up in public areas. The public cleaning company under the Ministry of Environment continues to provide some basic trash collection. However, the MC does not have the resources or equipment to clean up large piles of trash and rubble in public areas and streets. Many residents are also not aware of procedures for trash collection, which exacerbates the problem. Thus, citizens do not have any confidence in the MC’s ability to provide services. Moreover, many residents are not aware that the MC even exists and are clueless about its roles and responsibilities.
To address this challenge in Shahat, LTI2 will support Shahat MC (MC) and local civil society partners to conduct a cleanup and waste management community awareness campaign in Shahat. The MC was established in November 2014, and it consists of seven members and 40 council staff. LTI2 will provide MC with in-kind support to conduct a three month-long cleanup and community awareness campaign to clean up major public areas and streets and get normal trash collection procedures back on track. At the same time, the Shahat Municipal Council will be engaging with the Ministrity of Environment to ensure that financial support to the Shahat public clean up company continues after the major campaign ends. LTI2 will provide labor support (stipends) through the public clean up company, some cleanup equipment, and and outreach and community awareness campaign materials and services. LTI 2’s support will help increase effective local governance.

The activity seeks to increase confidence in the Shahat Municipal Council (SMC’s) ability to deliver basic services in coordination with national ministries. It targets the SMC, Ministry of Education Office in Shahat, around 2,000 students, and residents in Shahat. Lack of public services in Shahat in 2015 due to funding shortages and the national level political crisis sparked public demonstrations and undermined confidence in the SMC. Specifically, there is a huge need for school maintenance, due to the major increase of IDP students in Shahat and some schools being used for IDP housing. Thus, LTI 2 will support SMC and the ministry of education to conduct a maintenance project to refurbish water and sanitation facilities at 6 public schools in Shahat. There 11 elementary and secondary schools in Shahat and Ministry of Education with the MC has prioritized 6 schools most in need of repair. In addition, LTI 2 will work with SMC and the local Ministry of Education Office in Shahat will conduct media and public awareness campaign under the broader ""Our Shared Responsibility"" them to highlight the MC and Ministry of Education roles.

If we provide support the Shahat MC and Ministry of Education to rehabilitate restrooms in the 6 most needy schools in Shahat, then we can help the MC increase residents’ confidence in their ability to provide services, because:

- Shahat MC wants to deliver services and build a relationship with their community

- The schools is one of the most important service delivery issues to address based on concerns citizenshave raised through public protests and the assessment of international organizations

- The grantee will mobilize community volunteers and students to have a role in the rehabilitation of schools, linking them to what the MC is doing

- The awareness and information campaign will reinforce both the MC and the MOE role

In 2016, Libya’s political future is more uncertain than at any time since the 2011 revolution. In the past 2 years, political division, armed conflict and a crisis of legitimacy at the national level have accelerated the fragmentation of Libya’s governance landscape. Regional coalitions which formed in 2014 have fractured during 2015 and cities and municipalities have become increasingly isolated. Libya’s two nominal national governments both exert little authority outside their respective bases in Tripoli and Tobruk. The political elites involved in the UN-sponsored dialogue to form a unity government lack legitimacy and the country lacks a national political leadership that can claim a mandate to negotiate a solution to Libya’s crises. The collapse of the national-level political process and institutions has shifted significant governance responsibilities to local formal and informal actors. Municipal councils are viewed as the most credible institutions, though they face serious challenges to providing services to their constituents. The collapse of state institutions and the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security vacuum to strengthen its presence in Libya.
In light of the political conflict and dysfunction plaguing the national level since 2014, the country’s municipal councils, established a year earlier, remain Libya's most legitimate and functional democratic authority. According to LTI 2-sponsored research with Altai, a wide majority of Libyans have a positive perception of the role of the municipal councils. In Tripoli specifically, LTI 2 found in 2015 that 72 per cent of respondents perceived the councils as having a great deal or fair amount of legitimacy, significantly higher than any national institution. However, since these institutions are such a new concept in Libya, most Libyans lack a basic understand of the roles and responsibilities of the municipal councils and how constituents should engage with them. Moreover, given problems in the disbursal of national revenues, the municipal councils lack resources to exercise their authority, communicate effectively, and establish credibility among their constituents, leading to a decreasing trust of MCs. Also, linkages are weak between the MCs, as Libya's primary service-delivery bodies, and the national level ministries charged with overseeing and funding the MCs. Thus, with the goal of increasing confidence in local governance, LTI 2 is assisting several key municipal councils across Libya to better provide basic services, build bottom-up linkages with national ministries, and engage with residents.
Shahat MC (SMC) was established in November 2014, and it consists of seven members and 40 council staff. SMC has implemented some projects to provide services to the local community in the areas of infrastructure, health and education. However, SMC started to face difficulties in receiving fund from the national level government and, as a result, they stopped providing public services. This has eroded residents' confidence in the Shahat MC, and in early 2016 there were several public demonstrations expressing frustration over the lack of services. LTI 2 supported the SMC to conduct a quick-impact project in the spring/summer of 2016 to clean up public areas/streets and improve trash collection - a visible campaign to start to restore public confidence and engagement with the MC. LTI 2 and the SMC are continuing to partner to build upon that success - engaging with citizens to address service delivery needs and strengthening ties with national-level entities to ensure long-term sustainability. 
In this activity, LTI2 will provide the SMC with in-kind support to conduct a three month-long maintenance project and awareness campaign at 6 public schools in Shahat. The issue of education/schools and healthcare/ hospitals are the most critical basic services for both the national level and MCs to address. In the East, the primary school enrollment has dropped by as much as 50%, and Kobler highlighted the need to address this critical issue during a recent visit to Libya. Specifically, LTI 2 will support rehabilitation of water and sanitation facilities in 6 out of Shahat's 11 elementary schools. These restrooms are all out of services or in bad need of maintenance, as many of the schools have also housed IDPs in the past 2 years. SMC and the Ministry of Education office in Shahat conducted an assessment in May to identify the 6 schools most in need of repair, and LTI 2 will work with these 2 entities to refubrish the restroom facilities and water tanks in these schools. In addition, LTI 2 will support and outreach and media campaign about the effort under the broader ""Our Shared Responsibility"" theme.

The activity seeks to strengthen Bayda school students, parents, and families' awareness of the MC’s ability to deliver basic services and contribute to overall confidence in the participatory basic service delivery process at the local level. To achieve this objective, LTI will help the Bayda MC provide basic furnishings to priority, overcrowded public schools and conduct a public outreach and awareness campaign. Education and healthcare are the most critical basic services. In the East, the primary school enrollment has dropped by as much as 50% since the beginning of conflict in 2014. Taking advantage of MCs weak capacity to provide basic services, the military has started recently to sack the elected mayors in the East and replace them with military leaders. Especially in the East, it is critical that LTI strengthens public confidence in democratically- elected MCs. The campaign will target approximately 25 public schools – nearly 1,000 students will benefit directly. Bayda MC will lead the campaign since it is responsible for direct implementation of service delivery at the local level, with technical assistance from the local education office.
","
 IF Bayda MC provides basic furnishings to priority, overcrowded public schools and conducts a public outreach and awareness campaign, THEN Bayda school students, parents, and families have increased awareness of the MC’s ability to deliver basic services, BECAUSE:



- This is a high-priority need for many students and families in Bayda – especially the ones who will be direct affected by this activity. In the past year, many children have been turned away from schools in their area b/c of overcrowding or have had to seek space in other schools. Many of these have complained to the MC directly. The problem is particularly challenging for female students.



- We assume that Bayda MC providing these materials will allow overcrowded schools to accept more students. 



- We assume that the prioritization process for distributing these furnishings and supplies will be transparent, well-communicated, and accepted.



- MC  wants to help deliver services and build a relationship with their community, but they lack the sufficient resources.



- The target audience (families of students) lacks information about MC efforts to address critical public needs, and the public outreach campaign will be strong enough to address that issue.



- The schools rehabilitation is a highly visible project that all target beneficiaries will recognize and appreciate as a completed by the MC.

Since the signing of the Libya Political Agreement (LPA) in late 2015, Libya’s political future is hopeful but fragile. A new Government of National Accord (GNA) is working to help the country recover from two years of violent conflict between regional political factions. Despite strong support from the international community, powerful spoilers – particularly in the East – continue to challenge the GNA. Also, entrenched disdain for national level governance and rapidly eroding quality of life undermines the GNA’s credibility. Meanwhile, municipal councils have assumed significant governance responsibilities over the past 2 years, and they are still viewed as the most credible institutions. However, they face serious challenges in providing services to their constituents and are disconnected from national level counterparts and other local actors. Finally, the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security dysfunction to strengthen its influence.At the local level, municipal councils have tried to fill the gap left by absent national governance since 2014, and they remain Libya's most legitimate and functional democratic bodies. According to recent LTI 2-sponsored research, 55% of Libyans view municipal councils as legitimate. Yet, that legitimacy is eroding, as most MCs lack the resources to provide basic services and are detached from both national institutions, other local governance actors, and constituents. In response, LTI is supporting MCs and their partners to bolster the two critical pillars of effective local governance – basic service delivery and public outreach and communications. According to LTI 2 research, these are the two factors most correlated with public confidence in local governance. As a part of these activities, LTI 2 is facilitating relationships between national ministries and local actors to strengthen the long term institutional channels for the flow of resources and technical capacity to the local level. In addition, under the “Our Shared Responsibility” campaign, LTI 2 is helping MCs build a collaborative, participatory approach to governance involving civil society, tribal leaders, neighborhood councils, national representatives, and constituents. Where MC leadership is unsettled, LTI 2 is working more closely with community level actors to strengthen participatory governance and basic services. This includes CSOs, neighborhood councils, and ministry representatives, where possible.Bayda is a critical town in Eastern Libya - one of the few remaining urban areas in the East where the democratically elected MC is still functioning. Bayda MC was also one of the 3 Eastern MCs that signed the Libyan Political Agreement in December 2015, endorsing the GNA. At the same time it has hosted, often un-enthusiastically, the al-Thinni government and 2nd Central Bank since 2014. In Bayda, as in many of the municipalities in the East, the municipal council faces a lot of difficulties providing support to public services due to the lack of resources flowing from the national level. The MC has often asked for help from the Thinni government to address deteriorating infrastructure and basic services, but it has received no support. Specially, there is a huge gap in the education services, as Bayda MC is responsible for oversight and support to the local education office. Schools in the East have not really been getting any national-level support, and this lack of support has been exacerbated by the influx of IDPs from Benghazi to Bayda and Shahat over the past couple of years. Local Education Office in Bayda reported that most students in the majority of primary, elementary, and high schools in Bayda still study in poor conditions, making it harder for them to perform well. Four students share one desk in most of the classrooms, and classrooms lack basic supplies.In this activity, LTI will support the Bayda MC and local education office to better furnish and outfit 25-30 public schools in Bayda. LTI 2 will provide 350 student desks (2 students per desk), while the MC has agreed to provide new white boards and markers in these schools. MC and education office developed a draft prioritization list based the number of students who tried to apply for these schools and were rejected. In other words, the neighborhood schools that have experienced the highest levels of demand and unmet needs will receive priority. In addition, LTI will work with the MC to conduct a final consultation meeting involving the MC, education office, tribal leaders, school leaders, media and civil society to finalize the prioritization of schools and distribution plan. The MC will communicate this plan to the public after the meeting and begin the distribution process. Finally, LTI will support media and public awareness campaign under Our Shared Responsibility to highlight the MC and Local Education Office efforts.

There are 40 other students who could not join the center and some parents spending days in front of the center just waiting for a chance to send their children, the center do not have enough chairs and capacity to accept them. The autism center was established right after the Libyan revolution, the idea came to group of parents who have children with autism and they got tired of spending a lot of money to treat their children in foreign countries. The parents and other families from the community decided to build the center in the backyard of King Edreis old Castel in Bayda, soon after that the location was donated to the community by the former government. The center is owned by the community so everybody in Bayda feel they have responsibilities and ownership over the center which made many business men and public institutions to provide donations to the center including the Social Security institution in Bayda, which donated four buses to the center to be used for the children at the center. Other donations came from private contractor who built extra classrooms at the center. Recently the Education Office and Bayda MC started to take some initiatives to start providing support to the center because they feel they have obligations toward the children at the center. Bayda MC, Education Office and the community see that the center helps save a lot of money and efforts for families who face difficulties in sending their children to private centers outside the country. The center already provides the same support that could be provided outside the country and for free to all children and youths, the center has very qualified psychologists who spent years in this field teaching and treating autism cases in foreign countries. Also, the center has qualified teachers who were selected carefully by the center to make sure they can work professionally with the children and youths at the center. In general the center follow very restricted rules and polices that are stranded by international schools and centers for Autism outside the countries. 
In this activity, LTI will support the municipal council and local education office to upgrade the center with new equipment and materials. The MC will provide the Autism Center in Beyda 7-9 computer desktops that use to provide languages, listening and speech support to children and youths who have some difficulties in communications and responding to education. In addition, LTI and the MC will provide some audiovisual equipment, toy sets, and learning equipment for the children at the Autism Center.

The former government bought the CT scanner to provide services to all patients from the cities and villages in the eastern region and it cost the government 7 million LYD. However, the medical center cannot operate the device because of the electricity problem in the city. Thus, residents must pay a lot of money (up to 2,500 LYD) to go to private health facilities to receive these services. The CT scanner needs uninterrupted power supply in order to operate the device, and according to the engineers who work at the medical center they need a UPS device (similar to generator or back up battery) for the CT scanner. The Health Office and Bayda MC confirmed that if they can operate the CT scanner, they can help 25-40 patients every day. In this activity, LTI will provide Bayda Medical Center “through Bayda MC and the Health Office” a UPS back up power system to operate the CT scanner in the medical center in Bayda. The primary purpose of the CT scanner is for preventive medicine and screening for disease, for example for people with a high risk of colon cancer, or full-motion heart scans for people with high risk of heart disease. Even it can be used for full-body scans for the general population. The specific equipment needed is non-medical or non-technical equipment, so it will be easy for LTI 2 to procure, and it should take less than 1 month to setup.

This propaganda implicitly is promoting the idea that civilian municipal councils are ineffective, which councils controlled by the LNA are better at providing services and security. Strong strategic communications efforts from the Benghazi MC have reinforced this idea since its takeover by the LNA in August 2016. The Libyan National Army has justified appointing military mayors in the east by highlighting inability of local councils to provide basic services to citizens.

WHY/ISSUE: In the current conflict context, Libya's central authority is deeply fragmented and lacking legitimacy in the eyes of many Libyans. The result is increased pressure on sub-national level governance systems in the wake of heightened expectations by citizens that these systems can respond to their humanitarian and development needs and mitigate the effects of the conflict in their daily lives. Indeed, municipal councils (MCs) are viewed as the most credible institutions in Libya. According to LTI2-sponsored research, 55 percent of Libyans still view municipal councils as legitimate since their election in 2014.  That legitimacy, however, is eroding as most MCs lack the resources and responsibilities to effectively respond to citizen needs.
In eastern Libya, the Libyan National Army (LNA) under the command of General Khalifa Haftar is undermining Libya's democratically elected MCs by replacing the mayors with current or former military officers. Undercutting this tier of government helps Haftar to consolidate power and continue to challenge the Government of National Accord (GNA) and efforts to reach a national political compromise.  Haftar’s military mayors are aggressively publicizing their limited service delivery efforts, and are often taking credit for service delivery implemented by others, including the UNDP Stabilization Facility. Service delivery efforts have increased the military mayors’ popularity, often at the expense of the few remaining democratically elected mayors left in the east.  In some cases, citizens have asked the LNA to replace their elected mayors based on their belief that a military mayor will more effectively address their service delivery needs.
In response, LTI2 is supporting the remaining elected MCs and their partners to bolster the two critical pillars of effective local governance – basic service delivery as well as public outreach and communications. According to LTI 2 research, these are the two factors most correlated with public confidence in local governance.  Additionally, LTI2 is supporting strengthened relationships between national ministries and local actors by helping MCs embrace a collaborative and participatory approach to governance and service delivery that involves civil society, tribal leaders, neighborhood councils, national representatives, and constituents.
WHO/WHERE:  Shahat in eastern Libya is one of the few remaining urban areas in the East where a democratically elected MC is still functioning. Supporting Shahat MC to provide visible service delivery to its constituents will boost its credibility and legitimacy and therefore make it less likely that citizens call for, or accept, an LNA appointed military mayor.
HOW/WHAT:  The Shahat MC, like many municipalities in the East faces difficulties providing basic public services due to the lack of resources from the national government.  In February, residents organized major demonstrations to protest the lack of basic services including poor infrastructure maintenance, including road maintenance. The Shahat MC reports that one of the chief problems is road safety due to potholes and general disrepair along parts of the main road linking the downtown to other districts in Shahat. A lack of streetlights has also contributed to road accidents. One of the roads most in need of urgent maintenance is the southern road that links Gernada district to Shahat city center, about 7km in length. According to Shahat Traffic Police and SMC there are around 40 to 50 car accidents on this road every month, and 5 to 6 thousand people in Shahat use this road every day.
Through a fixed amount award, LTI 2 will support the Shahat MC to repair the southern road linking the Gernada district to Shahat City Center in 6 to 7 key spots and install road signs and reflectors.  Additionally, the MC will conduct and information campaign about the project as a part of the “Our Shared Responsibility” campaign to highlight the roles of the MC, the Traffic Authority, and the Municipal Project Office in addressing this problem. The campaign will use TV, radio, Facebook, and billboards to highlight the resourcefulness and responsiveness of the democratically elected municipal council to provide critical services.

This activity seeks to increase awareness in Tukrah municipal council's efforts to deliver critical services and contribute to overall confidence in the participatory basic service delivery process at the local level. To achieve this objective, LTI is providing Tukrah MC with submersible water pumps and all related accessories for several sites in Tukra area to make the wells  operational, while the municipal council is responsible for installation. In addition, LTI 2 is supporting the municipal council to conduct a media campaign and public outreach campaign to highlight the initiative and acknowledge MC efforts and give the community an announcement at when the MC will commence water services. Tukra municipal council is a democratically elected council about 80 km east of Benghazi and is responsible for the communities of Tukrah, Bursis, Bo Jrar, Ardania, El-Hmeda, Deryana and Sedi Ali. It is critical that LTI strengthen public confidence in democratically elected councils, since the army in the east has been targeting elected councils and try to replace them with militarized ones. This activity will contribute to overall confidence in the participatory basic service delivery process at the local level in Tukra area.

IF Tukrah municipal council provides water pumps (submersible and centrifugal) for the drilled wells in Tukrah area and conducts a public outreach campaign, THEN residents of Tokra have increased awareness of the Tokra council’s efforts to deliver critical services. BECAUSE:

  - The pumps installed will cover bigger area and even will provide fresh water for the outlying villages.       
  - Shortages of fresh water is one of the biggest problem that Tokra area has, overcoming this problem will benefits the MC and the residents. 
  - Media campaign will make the people aware that the MC is still active and doing its best to overcome one of the area’s biggest problems

Since the signing of the LPA in late 2015, Libya’s political future is hopeful but fragile. A new Government of National Accord (GNA) is working to help the country recover from two years of violent conflict between regional political factions. Despite strong support from the international community, powerful spoilers – particularly in the East – continue to challenge the GNA. Also, entrenched disdain for national level governance and rapidly eroding quality of life undermines the GNA’s credibility. Meanwhile, municipal councils have assumed significant governance responsibilities over the past 2 years, and they are still viewed as the most credible institutions. However, they face serious challenges in providing services to their constituents and are disconnected from national level counterparts and other local actors. Finally, the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security dysfunction to strengthen its influence.

At the local level, municipal councils have tried to fill the gap left by absent national governance since 2014, and they remain Libya's most legitimate and functional democratic bodies. According to recent LTI 2-sponsored research, 55% of Libyans view municipal councils as legitimate. Yet, that legitimacy is eroding, as most MCs lack the resources to provide basic services and are detached from both national institutions, other local governance actors, and constituents. In response, LTI is supporting MCs and their partners to bolster the two critical pillars of effective local governance – basic service delivery and public outreach and communications. According to LTI 2 research, these are the two factors most correlated with public confidence in local governance. As a part of these activities, LTI 2 is facilitating relationships between national ministries and local actors to strengthen the long term institutional channels for the flow of resources and technical capacity to the local level. In addition, under the “Our Shared Responsibility” campaign, LTI 2 is helping MCs build a collaborative, participatory approach to governance involving civil society, tribal leaders, neighborhood councils, national representatives, and constituents. Where MC leadership is unsettled, LTI 2 is working more closely with community level actors to strengthen participatory governance and basic services. This includes CSOs, neighborhood councils, and ministry representatives, where possible.

The current Tukrah Municipal Council was elected in the 22nd of February, 2015 by the locals, and it represents several different communities, that are located about 80km east from Benghazi. The communities represented by the council are ""Tukrah, Bursis, Bo Jrar, Ardania, El-Hmeda, Deryana and Sedi Ali"", the total population targeted by the council is 70,000. Mr. Ali Al-Abdli was pointed as the mayor, and the new council of Tokra (as capital) began operating as an executive committee in August 2015. They have 6 male members and one female member.
Tukrah municipal council lacks the fundamentals to provide services in the area, one of the main problems that Tukrah area has is “shortages of drinking (fresh) water.” The whole area depends on drilling water wells from nearby aquifers, and the main water tanks that provide fresh water to the area (there used to be 3 of them) had stopped working after the revolution and will take millions of dinars to repair them. The council made a good effort in the area by drilling two wells in Bo Jrar to cover the shortages, also drilled 5 wells additional in other areas and will drill 3 in the upcoming days to cover the shortages of fresh water in the area; however, the council lacks the funds to buy the pumps and related equipment, since they’re using the only funds they have (small fund) to buy emergency materials and medicines (syringes for antibiotics and insulin for Tukrah villager hospital) for the community. Six out of 11 wells should be in Tukrah (largest town), with the remainder covering the smaller villages outside Tukrah.
Thus, in this activity, LTI 2 will support Tukrah municipal council in completing this project to provide fresh water in the whole area. LTI will provide the council with 15 submersible water pumps and all related equipment, cables, security cages, control panels for the pumps. This equipment will help the wells that the MC has drilled to become operational, and the MC will also be responsible for all installation. Additionally, LTI 2 will support a public outreach campaign to highlight the MC efforts in delivering this service and to make the community acknowledge MC efforts to solve this problem in the area. This will include an opening ceremony, banners, fliers, and posters. The municipal council will arrange for television coverage. This activity will have a big and positive impact on the community in Tokra, providing such service will overcome one of the biggest problems in the area. If the municipal council played a key role in solving this problem, it will strengthen the relationship between them and the community and will increase confidence from the community to them. Especially in the East, it is critical that LTI strengthen public confidence in democratically- elected MCs as to stand against the trend of the military taking over municipal councils.

The activity seeks to increase awareness in Tukrah Municipal Council's ability to deliver critical services to residents of the community. To achieve this objective, LTI 2 will support Tukrah MC to install new equipment and refurbish  the birth section in order to make the facility fully functional at the Tukrah hospital The municipal council and Tukrah hospital have the facility and required equipment for the birth operation section, but the equipment was never installed and the facility never opened due to the launch of Operation Dignity in 2014. Tukrah residents currently rely on Benghazi Medical Center or private medical centers for birthing services, which the residents have an increasingly difficult time accessing. LTI 2 support will help the Tukrah Municipal Council to open the center and address a priority service delivery need. In addition, the MC will conduct a public outreach and awareness campaign and hold an opening ceremony to highlight the MC'service delivery efforts. The target community in and around Tukrah has democratically elected council and is located 80 km east of Benghazi. Throughout eastern Libya the LNA has been replacing elected councils with militarized ones - often accusing elected, civilian municipal councils of poor service delivery and dysfunction. Especially in the East, it is critical that LTI 2 strengthen public confidence in democratically-elected MCs such as Tukrah to stand against the trend of the militarizing municipal councils. This activity will contribute to overall confidence in the participatory basic service delivery process led by the municipal council and strengthen the relationship between the council and the community.

Throughout Eastern Libya, which is largely controlled by Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA), the LNA has forcibly replaced the mayors in many municipal councils with current or former military officers, thereby undermining the country’s last democratically elected bodies whose mandates haven’t expired. Undermining the councils helps Haftar, who opposes the GNA, consolidate power and continue to challenge efforts to reach a national political compromise. Particularly in Benghazi, the military mayor is aggressively publicizing basic service delivery efforts and taking credit for service delivery interventions implemented by others, including the UNDP Stabilization Facility. This tactic has increased the military mayors’ popularity, often at the expense of the few remaining democratically elected mayors left in the east. In some cases, citizens have asked the LNA to replace their elected mayors based on their belief that a military mayor will more effectively address their service delivery needs.
To counter this trend in the greater Benghazi region, LTI 2 has been supporting participatory service delivery efforts in the remaining democratically-elected civilian municipal councils in smaller towns like Suluq, Tukrah, and Qaminis. The current Tukrah Municipal Council was elected February 22, 2015,  and  represents several different communities about 80 km east of Benghazi, including  Tukrah,Bursis, Bo Jrar, Ardania, El-Hmeda, Deryana and Sedi Ali, which have  a combined population of about 70,000. Mr. Ali Al-Abdli was appointed as the mayor by the elected members, and the new council began operating as an executive committee in August 2015. The council has 6 male members and one female member. Despite lack of funding, Tukrah's elected municipal council is trying to provide services for the community, particularly in the areas of infrastructure, health and education.  One of the biggest problems in the health sector is lack of a functioning birth operations sector in the city’s main hospital. The council’s limited funds have been used to provide health departments with anti-biotics for newborn children and emergency services for adults.  However, the council lacks the necessary resources to help the hospital provide child birth services to the community. Locals of Tukrah and surroundings are forced to travel long distances to either Marj or Benghazi to give birth. In Benghazi, “Al-Jomhoria Hospital,” which is located in downtown Benghazi, used to provide birthing services, but the hospital has been shut down due to the security situation near Benghazi sea port. Patients seeking birthing services have been referred to “Benghazi Medical Center,"" which has prioritized providing services to military families and Benghazi residents.  Patients from Tukrah and surrounding areas are forced to use private medical centers, which many residents can’t afford or are unable to access as they lack adequate cash to pay due to the liquidity crisis.
Thus, in this activity, LTI2 will help the Tukrah MC to make functional the local hospital’s birth operations center. Tukrah villager hospital has the facility and the equipment for the birth operation center in Tukrah. However, when Operation Dignity was launched in 2014, no one provided funding to install the equipment or provide necessary maintenance to make the birth center operational. Through a fixed amount award grant to the Tukrah MC, LTI 2 will provide support to install all of the medical equipment (which is currently in storage) and do minor repairs to the building in order to provide a sterile, suitable environment for the facility to function. LTI2 will also support an opening ceremony at Tukrah Birth Operations Center along with Facebook media advertisement for the activity sponsored in Tukrah MC’s official page. Highlighting the municipal council's key role in addressing this problem will strengthen the relationship between the council and the community and will increase awareness of the council's efforts to address critical service delivery issues. Especially in the East, it is critical that LTI 2 strengthen public confidence in democratically-elected MCs in order to confront the trend of the military taking over municipal councils.

LTI 2 will purchase all materials and equipment required for these upgrades, while the municipal council and public water company will be responsible for installation and maintenance. The current water network infrastructure in central Suluq is dysfunctional or corroded in many places, which has resulted in poor water service delivery. The municipal council was working on a long-term project to resolve these issues before the revolution but has lacked funding to address water network problems since 2011. Providing this support will address one of the biggest services problems in the area, where residents often complain to the municipal council office about irregular access to water and water contamination. LTI 2 will also support the municipal council to conduct a media and public outreach campaign to highlight the initiative and acknowledge municipal council efforts during and after the project. Suluq municipal council is a democratically elected council located 62 km south of Benghazi. The council is responsible for basic service provision  in Suluq, Jerdina, Silk, Masiklo, Al-Tilmoon,  Wadi Al-Bab, Al-Jhf and Masoos districts. It is critical that LTI 2 support efforts to strengthen public confidence in civilian, democratically elected councils, since the LNA has been replacing elected civilian mayors with military appointees.. This activity will contribute to building confidence in the participatory basic service delivery process led by the municipal council in Suluq.

Suluq is located about 62 KM south of Benghazi. The municipal council was elected on June 24, 2014 and, has 6 male members and 1 female member. The council is providing services in the Suluq, Jerdina, Silk, Masiklo, Al-Tilmoon, Wadi Al-Bab, Al-Jhf and Masoos districts, and the current elected Mayor is Mr. Basheer Abdil Salam Al-Jermani. One of the main problems that Suluq city faces is its weak infrastructure.   Many areas in the city have suffered from bad lighting, decrepit sewage canals, and irregular access to water.. In the Suluq area, the main water source , the Omar Al-Mukhtar Basin, has stopped functioning due to corroded pipes. In 2008, the municipal council and Suluq water company started working with the Brazilian company Queiroz Galvao to resolve water issues throughout the city. However, Queiroz Galvao only addressed about 10% of the city’s water infrastructure issues before leaving the country in 2011 after the revolution and never returning

An area called “Police Station Neighborhood” is located near  the Omul Qura Mosque, which is the largest in Suluq.  Police Station Neighborhood is a  central area with 235 households, a mosque and the central police station, and the neighborhood’s infrastructure has deteriorated significantly in recent years. Sewage contaminates the neighborhood’s water canals, which provide fresh water to homes in the area.. The MC has tried to address sewage contamination, but lacks the required funding to solve repair the neighborhood’s pipes.



In this activity LTI 2 will support Suluq Municipal Council to replace damaged sections in the  water network in ""Suluq Police Station Neighborhood.” This support will include pipes, accessories, and equipment required for installation. Providing this service will address one of the most significant services problems in the area. The municipal council, in cooperation with the Suluq Water Company, will be responsible for installation of the new materials and any subsequent repairs. In addition, LTI 2 will support the municipal council to conduct a public outreach and awareness campaign to inform the public about this project. If the municipal council plays solving visible role in addressing this priority services problem, it will strengthen the relationship between the council and the community and will increase awareness among residents of the municipal council's efforts to address critical service delivery issues. Especially in the East, it is critical that LTI support efforts to strengthen public confidence in democratically-elected MCs in an effort to stand against the trend of the military taking over municipal councils.

The Bayda Municipal Council will lead efforts to improve the Center since it is responsible for service delivery at the local level, with technical assistance from the Local Education Office and Social Security Office. Citizens in the east have prioritized projects in the education and healthcare sectors, particularly given the impact of mass displacement and conflict during the past three years.  The Libyan National Army has justified appointing military mayors in the east by highlighting inability of local councils to provide basic services to citizens.  Therefore, particularly in eastern Libya, it is critical that LTI 2 strengthen public confidence in democratically elected MCs by helping them address service delivery priorities through participatory processes and engage in public outreach to inform citizens of their efforts.

Throughout Eastern Libya, which is largely controlled by Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA), the LNA has forcibly replaced the mayors in many municipal councils with current or former military officers, thereby undermining the country’s last democratically elected bodies whose mandates haven’t expired.Undermining the councils helps Haftar, who opposes the GNA, consolidate power and continue to challenge efforts to reach a national political compromise.  Haftar’s military mayors are aggressively publicizing their limited service delivery efforts, and are often taking credit for service delivery interventions implemented by others, including the UNDP Stabilization Facility. Service delivery efforts have increased the military mayors’ popularity, often at the expense of the few remaining democratically elected mayors left in the east.  In some cases, citizens have asked the LNA to replace their elected mayors based on their belief that a military mayor will more effectively address their service delivery needs.

Bayda is a critical town in Eastern Libya because it is one of the few remaining urban areas in the East where the democratically elected MC is still functioning and has not had a military mayor forced upon the council. Supporting Bayda MC to provide visible service delivery to its constituents will boost its credibility and legitimacy and therefore make it less likely that citizens call for, or accept, an LNA appointed military mayor. In Bayda, as in many of the municipalities in the East, the MC faces difficulties providing public services due to the lack of resources from the national government. The MC has often asked for help from the parallel Thinni government, which is allied with Haftar and rivals the GNA, to address deteriorating infrastructure and basic services, but it has received no support.  Bayda citizens have prioritized addressing gaps in education services provided in the city. Bayda MC is responsible for oversight of, and support for, the local education office, but lacks the funds and capacity to effectively address services needs in the education sector.  Based on community demands the Bayda MC conducted a needs assessment of the Bayda Center for the Blind, a public education institution, and found critical gaps in its capacity to serve its students.

The Bayda Center for the Blind was established in 1998 by the Social Security Office and Education Office in Bayda to educate blind students from the Green Mountain area. The center educates approximately 30 primary school students from Bayda and surrounding areas such as Shahat and Maraj,  as well as blind college students who use the center’s equipment and services.  The center also provides literacy services to around 70 blind people of different ages and genders from Bayda and surrounding areas. According to local stakeholders, there is limited access to braille language printers in Eastern Libya and the Center lacks basic educational materials and tools required by blind students to teach blind students to type, write reports, communicate, and work on computers. 



In this activity, LTI 2 will support the Bayda MC, Local Education Office, and Social Security Office to provide the Bayda Center for the Blind with braille language tools to help blind students with reading, writing, and arithmetic. Additionally, LTI 2 will support a media and public awareness campaign under the 'Our Shared Responsibility' slogan to highlight the MC, Bayda Social Security Office, and the Local Education Office roles in addressing a priority service delivery need in Bayda. By supporting the Center, the activity will help increase citizen awareness of the Bayda MC's ability to deliver critical public services. It will also contribute to strengthened confidence in civilian, democratically-elected municipal councils to help these councils resist the recent trend of the LNA taking over local governance institutions in the East.

IF Qaminis Municipal Council restores functionality with provision of furniture and equipment to 9 schools in Magroon area and conducts a public awareness campaign about the refurbishment of schools, THEN the community will have more confidence in the municipal council’s ability to lead participatory basic service delivery, BECAUSE:

-This is a high-priority need according to many students and families in Magroon. (The schools were heavily damaged and looted in the fighting.)

- We assume that the prioritization process for distributing these furnishings and supplies will be transparent, well-communicated, and accepted by the community.


- The media campaign will keep the people updated on the municipal council activities regarding this matter, in terms of furnishing and preparing the schools by MC.
",Qaminis Schools Furnishing,"
Since the signing of the Libya Political Agreement (LPA) in late 2015, Libya’s political future is hopeful but fragile. A new Government of National Accord (GNA) is working to help the country recover from two years of violent conflict between regional political factions. Despite strong support from the international community, powerful spoilers – particularly in the East – continue to challenge the GNA.  Entrenched disdain for national level governance and rapidly eroding quality of life undermines the GNA’s credibility. Meanwhile, municipal councils have assumed significant governance and service delivery responsibilities over the past 2 years, and they are still viewed as the most credible institutions. However, they face serious challenges in providing services to their constituents and are disconnected from national level counterparts and other local actors. Finally, the fragmentation of Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism, with the Islamic State and other extremist organizations taking advantage of governance and security dysfunction to strengthen their influence.
At the local level, municipal councils have tried to fill the governance vacuum since 2014, and they remain Libya's most legitimate and functional democratic bodies. According to recent LTI 2-sponsored research, 55% of Libyans view municipal councils as legitimate. Yet, that legitimacy is eroding, as most MCs lack the resources to provide basic services and are detached from national institutions, other local governance actors, and constituents. In response, LTI 2 is supporting MCs and their partners to bolster two critical pillars of effective local governance – basic service delivery and public outreach and communications. According to LTI 2 research, these are the two factors most correlated with public confidence in local governance in Libya. As part of these activities, LTI 2 is facilitating relationships between national ministries and local governance stakeholders to strengthen the long-term institutional channels for the flow of resources and technical capacity to the local level. In addition, under the “Our Shared Responsibility” campaign, LTI 2 is helping MCs build a collaborative, participatory approach to governance and service delivery involving civil society, tribal leaders, neighborhood councils, national representatives, and constituents. Where MC leadership is unsettled, LTI 2 is working more closely with community level actors to strengthen participatory governance and basic services. This includes CSOs, neighborhood councils, and ministry representatives, where possible.
Throughout Eastern Libya, which is largely controlled by Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA), the LNA has forcibly replaced the mayors in many municipal councils with current or former military officers, thereby undermining the country’s last democratically elected bodies whose mandates haven’t expired. Undermining the councils helps Haftar, who opposes the GNA, consolidate power and continue to challenge efforts to reach a national political compromise. Particularly in Benghazi, the military mayor is aggressively publicizing basic service delivery efforts and taking credit for service delivery interventions implemented by others, including the UNDP Stabilization Facility. This tactic has increased the military mayors’ popularity, often at the expense of the few remaining democratically elected mayors left in the east. In some cases, citizens have asked the LNA to replace their elected mayors based on their belief that a military mayor will more effectively address their service delivery needs.
To counter this trend in the great Benghazi region, LTI 2 has been supporting participatory service delivery efforts in the remaining democratically-elected civilian municipal councils in smaller towns like Suluq, Tokra, and Qaminis. Qaminis is located about 50 km South of Benghazi. The municipal council was elected in the summer of 2014, with 6 male and 1 female member. Qaminis municipal council is currently running services for Qaminis and other districts surrounding the town including Magroon. Because of the clashes that happened between the LNA and Benghazi Defense Brigade (BDB) in 2016, in that particular area between Benghazi and Ajdabia, the area suffered a lot in terms of infrastructure, health and education sectors degradation, especially Magroon district which falls under Qaminis Municipal Council jurisdiction, All nine of the Magroon area's main schools have been damaged due to ongoing fighting between the two parties, and classrooms, chairs, and offices were all sabotaged. Qaminis Municipal Council made a good effort despite the lack of funding, they have rebuilt the damaged schools, doing infrastructure works, bathrooms repairing, lighting and painting as well. However, they don’t have enough funds to buy basic educational furniture and all related equipment and items to make the schools fully functional again.
Thus, in this activity, LTI 2 will support the Qaminis MC and local education office to complete the refurbishment of the 9 public schools in Magroon. LTI 2 will provide 300 double school desks, 70 chairs, 48 whiteboards, 11 office desks with chairs, and a set of equipment for administration use, MC and education office will develop a draft prioritization list for the 9 schools for desks and boards distribution based on their location, needs and size of each school. In addition, LTI 2 will work with the Municipal Council to conduct an opening ceremony in one of the biggest schools in Magroon area. The Municipal Council will invite the media to highlight the refurbishment of the schools, and the event will be open to the community to increase awareness of the municipal council's efforts. LTI 2 will also support the distribution of printed materials to students and their parents under Our Shared Responsibility to highlight the MC and Local Education Office efforts. Highlighting the municipal council's key role in addressing this problem will strengthen the relationship between them and the community and will increase awareness of the council's efforts to address critical service delivery issues. Especially in the East, it is critical that LTI 2 strengthen public confidence in democratically-elected MCs as to stand against the trend of the military taking over municipal councils.

",Human Rights Training for Youth in Eastern Libya,"
Human Rights Solidarity, a non-governmental organization directed at publicizing human rights abuses in Libya, was founded in Switzerland in 1999 by Dr. Ahmed Ghweidi, a Libyan medical doctor and activist.  Following the 17 February uprising in Benghazi, Human Rights Solidarity returned its headquarters to Libya.

The Abu Salim prison massacre of 1996 was impetus for the group’s creation and for its publication of the event’s definitive account, which was released in book-form and will also comprise a film (now in production).  Research for the book involved more than 400 interviews with victims and their families, a process that introduced Human Rights Solidarity to a range of reporting techniques appropriate to the reconciliation and state-building aims of post-revolutionary Libya.  The group has been active in hosting, supporting, and participating in dozens of human-rights events in Benghazi since the ousting of Qaddafi’s government from the city, and it plays a leadership role vis-à-vis similarly motivated organization that have more recently constituted themselves in eastern Libya.

Because of this role in the NGO community, volunteers and staff at Human Rights Solidarity are in a position to lead civil society in a process that will document human rights abuses of the Qaddafi regime, seek justice for those abuses, and incorporate principles of international human rights law into Libya’s post-revolutionary code.  To do this effectively, members of Human Rights Solidarity, as well as other leading human rights promoters in Benghazi, require specific training in the conventions, treaties, justice systems and monitoring techniques that constitute the systematic protection of internationally recognized human rights. 

This project will provide that knowledge by facilitating a week-long event in Benghazi, led by three expert trainers from Poland, Maria Ejchart, Anna Husarska, and Karolina Kedziora, who have long experience working with human rights groups in transitional societies around the world.  Over six full-days of training the course will address: 

1.	Basic human rights principles – their history and evolution
2.	International human rights law – conventions, treaties, and protections.
3.	Specific issues in human rights, including right-to-life, freedom of expression, and freedom from torture.
4.	Human rights advocacy.
5.	Human rights monitoring – techniques and management.

In addition to the training of its own members, Libya Human Rights Solidarity will invite the participation of other leading human-rights advocates from civil society and the press.

This activity is one of the first efforts in post-Qadhafi Libya to empower 50 civil society leaders with the tools to effectively manage conflicts in their own communities without government control.  The grant funds a three-day intensive conflict management training by international experts from the U.S. Institute for Peace, with subject matter that includes consensus-building and collaborative problem solving. The workshop will take place in Benghazi, the birthplace of the February 17 revolution and a city widely populated with civil society leaders that are dedicated to bringing democracy to their country; participants will be drawn from communities throughout eastern Libya. By developing their abilities to resolve destabilizing local conflicts, the grant will help strengthen the legitimacy of participating civil society leaders in their communities.   Ultimately, these experts will lay the foundation for a nationwide network of conflict-resolution professionals whose leadership will help ensure Libya’s peaceful transition to democratic governance.

",Conflict Mitigation Training in Eastern Libya,"
Post-revolutionary Libya will be defined by complex social, political, and economic disputes as the country moves towards the establishment of democratic governance.  Because of its prominent role in Libya’s nascent NGO community, volunteers and staff at Human Rights Solidarity are in a position to lead civil society in a process that will help to mitigate these conflicts.  Human Rights Solidarity, in conjunction with the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), proposes to launch a capacity building program that will train and equip a nationwide team of community leaders who are specialized in collaborative problem-solving techniques, as well as conflict transformation tools and methods.  

The activities of this grant will constitute the first phase of the recruitment and training effort, and will be followed by similar programs coordinated and funded by the USIP.  The training is designed to serve as both a stand-alone capacity-building activity for the 50 participants involved, and as a tool that will assist experts from the USIP in identifying and recruiting a pool of highly-motivated civil society leaders for more advanced courses in conflict-resolution techniques.  In the course of this event, USIP experts will select 25 participants for onward mentorship. 

The program will consist of a three-day training course focusing on general principles that individuals can use to address conflict in their communities.  Discussion topics for the training course will include:

1.	Understanding types of conflict
2.	Conflict transformation versus conflict settlement
3.	Collaborative problem solving
4.	Third-party intervention
5.	Facilitating conflict remediation
6.	Communication skills
7.	Consensus-building techniques

Human Rights Solidarity is a non-governmental organization working to ensure a peaceful transition in Libya, and a political future that respects the rights of all citizens.  The organization was founded in Switzerland in 1999 by Dr. Ahmed Ghweidi, a Libyan medical doctor and activist.

",Workshop: Media and the Law in Libya,"
In the weeks and months that have followed the February 17 uprising in Libya, dozens of revolutionary media outlets have sprouted, and many have begun to mature.  These organizations and their associated journalists are at the vanguard of Libya’s transition to a culture that values the freedom of information, freedom of expression and freedom of the press.

	And yet this progress toward a free press has suffered from a lack of practical familiarity with the ethics and responsibilities of independent reporting.  In particular, post-revolutionary media outlets – including print media, radio, and television – have raised concerns that their burgeoning press corps does not properly understand the legal underpinnings of its trade.  New guidelines proffered by the NTC have complicated anchors in Qaddhafi-era statues; these are further muddled by competing interpretations of rights embedded in the 1951 constitution.  And while the international community has worked diligently, in the form of trainings and workshops, to introduce broad concepts of free journalism in Libya, many practitioners feel that these trainings have left unresolved the more localized and precise questions of legal right and legal liability.

	A clear understanding of rights and liabilities is essential to the successful evolution of free journalism in Libya.  Already reporters in the post-revolutionary era are being sued by subjects of their reporting, and major controversies have surrounded the suspect coverage of landmark events and social tensions.  If the press is not able to systematically defend its legal prerogatives, the media as a whole may trend away from a brand of journalism that ensures government transparency, public accountability, and other democratic objectives.  Likewise, the profession risks discredit if it does not acknowledge and enforce legal standards of fairness and accuracy.

	This project will solicit the expertise of Li trbyan trainers and practitioners who can speak authoritatively about laws relating to press freedoms in Libya.  Approximately 48 members of various media outlets in eastern Libya will participate in a 3-day workshop, guided by an expert international trainer, with the added participation of lawyers, government representatives, and guest presenters active in the profession.  The international trainer is Graeme Wood, a journalist with over a decade of experience reporting throughout the world, and who has trained journalists in cambodia and given lectures about journalism to students in the U.S. and abroad.

Together the participants in the workshop will discuss:

•	The rights of a free press and the principles of free speech
•	The historical practice of journalism in Libya, from independence in 1951, through the 17 February revolution
•	The place of traditional media under current law
•	The place of the “New Media” under current law
•	Organizational and reporting strategies for Libyan media going forward
•	The role of media during Libya’s transitional period
•	The constitutional and legal priorities of a free press 

The training will be broken into two three-day sessions over six days, with 24 participants attending each session.  Material will be delivered in lecture format, as well as in the context of round-table discussions that invite the contributions of relevant practitioners in media, the law, and government.  Each workshop includes 10 modules total over three days (Mr. Wood will lead four of the modules and participate in the others). Participants will be chosen by soliciting nominations from established media outlets that are registered with the NTC – 2 per organization.  It is expected that roughly half of the participants will draw from media organizations in Benghazi, with the rest coming from smaller communities throughout eastern Libya.

This activity will build momentum behind efforts, initiated by the Public Engagement arm of the NTC's Media & Communications Committee in the wake of the February 17 revolution, to enable emergent civil society groups in eastern Libya to hone and execute their missions. The grant will finance materials, space and technical expertise (arranged by the US Institute for Peace) for a two-day civic education workshop for key civil society leaders on topics including the roles and responsibilities of civil society in a democracy, skills for managing the mission and activities of NGOs, and strategic collaboration between participating CSO representatives.  The event will take place in Benghazi, the organizational hub for two of Libya’s largest umbrella organizations in civil society: the NGO Coalition and the NGO Union, which will coordinate with the PEU and USIP to select workshop participants.

",Civic Education & Organizational Development for Emergent NGOs,"
The Public Engagement Unit (PEU) is part of the National Transitional Council’s Media & Communications Committee.  In addition to facilitating press conferences and public forums for the NTC, the PEU has from its inception played a leading role in publicizing and coordinating the activities of NGOs throughout Eastern Libya in the wake of the February 17 revolution.  The PEU organized widely-attended NGO fairs in May and July, effectively jumpstarting the capacity-building process for dozens of organizations, and cementing its place as a uniting force behind their disparate efforts to foment positive change.  In particular, the PEU has worked to bring together two of the dominant forces in Libyan Civil Society – the NGO Coalition and the NGO Union – the two umbrella organizations targeted by this grant. The PEU has also worked very closely with the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) throughout the post-revolutionary period, including direct coordination with USIP in the design of this activity.  

The two-day workshop will be held in Benghazi.  The purpose of the workshop will be to inform participants broadly about civics and more specifically about the key roles and responsibilities that civil society plays in a democracy, and to transfer knowledge on how to build the capacity of their respective NGOs. It will challenge organizational leaders from the Coalition and the Union to devise a strategic framework for collaborative efforts along specific lines of action.  Additionally, the workshop will address strategic approaches to missions in humanitarian assistance, the provision of services, and participation in electoral and constitutional process.  

Training for the program will be provided by a team of experts identified and transported to/from Benghazi by USIP.  USIP will also provide essential course materials, including DVDs and other informational products.  Participants will include nominated individuals from the management boards at the NGO Coalition and the NGO Union.  Discussion topics for the training course will comprise:

1.	Understanding the definition and roles of civil society
2.	Fundamental principles and best practices for NGOs
3.	Defining core values, vision, and mission
4.	NGO Management
5.	Strategic collaboration and networking
6.	Program implementation and monitoring

It should be noted that neither the PEU, nor OTI, envisions a sustained role for NTC bodies in the daily operations of Libya’s NGO community.  The activities of this grant should be considered a capping initiative for a nascent government that hopes to promote a vigorous and independent NGO community.  The PEU has been an effective convener of organizations in the past, and it is assumed that aside from this role, the NTC will remain outside of future planning efforts and/or program implementation of Libya's rising, independent civil society.

",Support for Civil Society Resource Center Inaugural Event,"
Under the Jamahiriya, Civil Society Organizations had to go through an extensive and complicated process to register with the government. Any organization that was not registered was illegal, and the process was weighted to discourage civil society formation—according to key informants who were active in organizations under Qaddafi, only those who had regime members in the organization were permitted to exist. Even after registration, organizations were ultimately prevented from operating in the true fashion of an open civil society, and thus were not able to develop the skills and competencies essential to success.  After the 17th of February, when NGOs were forming at a rapid pace, they were merely required to register their name and a contact person with the Ministry of Social Affairs. The openness for new organizations and spontaneous energy to respond to the conflict created an environment where the number of organizations registered ballooned from approximately 22 in all of Libya before the revolution to over 150 in Benghazi alone by July 2011.

The National Transitional Council has responded to this demand for representation and rapid growth by forming a new Executive Office of Culture and Civil Society tasked with re-drafting the registration process and overseeing relations between the government and civil society. The Office of Culture and Civil Society is in the final stages of preparing new guidelines for local NGOs, and is going to require all local organizations to re-register. Instead of only providing a name and contact number, NGOs will have to demonstrate a deeper organizational capacity, notably through presenting a charter or constitution. NGOs will have to submit much more detailed information to successfully register.

While this effort is a potentially important step towards encouraging NGOs to think strategically and strengthen their internal frameworks, those that have not previously drafted a constitution or thought about their mission may struggle with the new requirements. Understanding one’s role in civil society is a laudable and crucial goal for the successful existence of any CSO in any country in the world, however the registration process should not be a barrier to local organizations, and the process as it stands now could inadvertently benefit organizations led by individuals of more privileged backgrounds. 

As organizations scramble to fulfill requirements for the registration process, they may miss a valuable opportunity to fully evaluate the goals and mission of their individual organizations and to craft a meaningful constitution/charter in a consultative way. Ultimately, civil society will become a welcome fixture on the Libyan horizon and in order to impact society in a positive way, actors must be given the tools and skills with which to succeed. Additionally, many, if not most, organizations do not have office space or internet access, and thus will face additional challenges in organizing and holding professional meetings and will struggle to benefit from the wealth of information available online, including educational resources, case studies and networking opportunities.

After consulting with civil society leaders, local NGO members, and members of the National Transitional Council involved with civil society, INGO Mercy Corps decided to establish a Civil Society Resource and Learning Center in coordination with the Office of Culture and Civil Society Affairs in Benghazi.  A direct grant (as opposed to a GUC) from USAID/OTI of $88,000 to Mercy Corps helped equip and fund the first three months of the Center's operations; Mercy Corps provided matching funds through a private foundation that will finance operations for an additional 3 months.  Mercy Corps is actively exploring sustainable mechansims, in addition to both private and donor options for follow-on funding, that will support the center's long-term operational costs.

The Center was given the name Hamzat Wasl, a grammatical tool in Arabic that brings sound to silent syllables or in this case, metaphorically speaking, brings capacity to nascent organizations.  Hamzat Wasl is an institution at which all civil society actors from Benghazi and beyond can access information, learn and network, while also providing crucial capacity building support to both civil society. The center offers  a variety of services, including training space, internet stations/work space, a resource library, and will also post a job opportunities board for posting volunteer opportunities for rising young activists both with CSOs and at the center.

The new GUC to Hamzat Wasl will support a day-long inaugural event, with more than 30 participating organizations, that will include an open house in the morning, a ribbon cutting ceremony and reception, a panel discussion, networking activities, and a formal introduction to the services offered by the Resource Center.  The panel will comprise influential members of international non-governmental organizations, Libyan civil society, and the National Transitional Council.  It will focus on the appropriate and necessary roles of civil society actors during Libya’s transition to democracy.

	Thje event as a whole will give a broad cross-section of Libyan civil-society the opportunity to make formal and informal connections, recruit members, identify possibilities for collaboration, and learn about the ways that organizations can contribute to Libya’s changing political and cultural landscape.  For nascent organizations, the event will also provide an opportunity to explore resources at the Center that may prove essential for an organization’s official registration, its adoption of governing principles and statement of mission, as well as its onward management as a sustainable entity.

Replicating a successful activity piloted through USAID/OTI's first grant in Libya, this training workshop will raise awareness about human rights by training young members of a fast-growing Libyan human rights organization to identify and protect against rights abuses.  At the request of the local organization, Human Rights Solidarity, this USAID/OTI grant funded materials and participation of two technical experts from the Geneva Institute for Human Rights (GIHR) for a five-day workshop in Benghazi, the birthplace of the Libyan revolution.  The workshop will cover the history and evolution of human rights principles, pertinent international laws, protection strategies, and the role of civil society in human rights monitoring and advocacy.  After the Benghazi workshop is completed, the GIHR trainers will implement a second five-day workshop in the capital for rising young advocates from Tripoli (in collaboration with OTI partner Chemonics); the activity will be the first implemented by Human Rights Solidarity's newly established Tripoli office.

",Human Rights Training in Benghazi and Tripoli,"
Human Rights Solidarity, a non-governmental organization directed at publicizing human rights abuses in Libya, was founded in Switzerland in 1999 by Dr. Ahmed Ghweidi, a Libyan medical doctor and activist.  Following the 17 February uprising in Benghazi, Human Rights Solidarity returned its headquarters to Libya.

The group has been active in hosting, supporting, and participating in dozens of human-rights events in Benghazi since the ousting of Qaddafi’s government from the city.  From 8-14 September, 2011, the organization hosted an OTI-funded human rights training event in Benghazi that was highly successful (BENDAI001).  During this course, young participants from a wide range of civil society and media organizations were introduced to basic human rights principles, critical components of international human rights law, human rights monitoring techniques, protection methods, and advocacy strategies.   By way of this program and others, Human Rights Solidarity has established a leadership role vis-à-vis similarly motivated organization that have more recently constituted themselves in eastern Libya.  

Trainers for the event held in September were recruited from the Helsinki Foundation in Warsaw, Poland, and were strictly English-speaking.  Participation was therefore limited to only those young activists with a high degree of proficiency in English.   After-action reports from that event included recommendations that a similar courses be held in Arabic for a wider cross-section of the population. Since hosting its first grant under OTI’s Regional Option (BENDAI001), Human Rights Solidarity has also gained a strong operational foothold in the capital.  The current grant, therefore, will aim to deliver two five-day trainings, back-to-back, located in both Benghazi and Tripoli.  

For training services DAI, in close consultation with OTI and with Libyan Human Rights Solidarity, proposes to retain the services of expert trainers from the Geneva Institute for Human Rights.  The Geneva Institute has deep experience implementing programs similar to the one proposed, including training experience with Libyan organizations.  The Center has a long record of success working with the international offices of Libyan Human Rights Solidarity, and has contributed substantially to the development of the proposed curriculum. The Institute can provide native Arabic-speaking trainers, and has the capacity to deploy immediately to Benghazi.

Because the program will take place in both Benghazi and Tripoli, implementation support for activities will be divided among OTI’s two implementing partners in Libya – DAI and Chemonics.  Each implementing partner will enter into its own grant agreement with the respective offices of Human Rights Solidarity in the two cities.  DAI’s role under its own grant will be to secure all technical services provided by the Geneva Institute, including the salaries, transportation costs (international and domestic), and materials costs associated with trainings in both Benghazi and Tripoli.  DAI’s grant activities will also include all facilitation requirements on the ground in Benghazi.  Chemonics will sponsor its own grant that will accommodate local facilitation requirements on the ground in Tripoli.

The trainings themselves will comprise two five-day events that will address: 

1.	Basic human rights principles – their history, evolution, and institutional significance.
2.	International human rights law – conventions, treaties, and protections.
3.	Protection strategies – relevant institutions, conventions, and mechanisms.
4.	The role of civil society in human rights monitoring and advocacy.

In addition to the training of its own members, Libya Human Rights Solidarity will invite the participation of other leading human-rights advocates from civil society and the press.  For the Benghazi-based training, Human Rights Solidarity will also include participants from Baida’ and Misrata.

These suites will be used for specific trainings offered by subject-matter experts at the center, and they will also be available for check-out, according to the center’s lending policy.

",Procurement of Audio/Video Equipment for Hamzat Wasl Civil Society Center,"
Established in September, 2011, the Benghazi Civil Society Resource Center, or Hamzat Wasl, is a focal point for the activities of non-governmental organizations throughout eastern Libya.  The Center closely collaborates with subject matter experts employed by Mercy Corps and other international organizations working in Benghazi to support and benefit Libyan civil society organizations.  Through these international advisors, as well as Libyan professional staff, IT resources, and other forms of support, the Center aims to build the management capacity of local CSOs and to encourage CSOs to work together in pursuit of common causes.

	A core mission of Hamzat Wasl is to build the capacity of civil society organizations to distribute and amplify their messages across an ever-growing audience of government officials, business leaders, international organizations, and ordinary citizens.  The center believes that this outreach capacity ought to involve the production of media products in a variety of categories, including photographic, video-documentary, and print-media campaigns.  The center seeks to provide this capacity by acquiring photographic, computing, audio-recording, and printing resources, which will be available to civil-society organizations for short periods of time.

	Enhancing organizations’ ability to communicate their messages across a variety of media will achieve a number of important goals.  It will afford CSOs greater opportunity to strengthen democratic interests, especially those built on public awareness of important social, political, cultural, and policy issues.  It will bring a new dimension and new depth to advocacy campaigns that, due to limited financial resources at most grass-roots organizations, are typically carried-out on foot.  It will bridge the gap between civil-society and the commercial media, allowing even the smallest organizations the potential to reach a national audience.  And it will provide a natural draw for an ever-growing number of organizations to work side-by-side, in a central location, where they can network, share experiences and skills, and coordinate action.

	This project aims to procure, on behalf of Hamzat Wasl, four sets of equipment that will each constitute a full audio-video production suite.  It will include the delivery of four work-stations with software to support a variety of sophisticated graphic applications.  It will also include the delivery of four cameras capable of both video and still-image photography, audio equipment for recording events and interviews, as well as lighting and other required accessories.  The grant will also include procurement of a large-format printer, which will be shared among the work-stations.

	After delivery of the equipment, Hamzat Wasl ai will host two intensive training courses (the first through a separate OTI grant) that will invite representatives from approximately 30 civil society organizations to develop their skills in media advocacy, documentary photo-exhibition and film-making, as well as IT production techniques.  Trained users of the supplied equipment will then be able to utilize and borrow resources from the center, in accordance with the center’s lending policy.

	The list of equipment to be procured is as follows:

1.	Four all-in-one computer workstations capable of advanced photo and video editing
2.	Four registered copies of Adobe Photoshop Elements 9 and Adobe Premiere Elements 9
3.	Four digital SLR cameras capable of photo and video recording
4.	Four lapel microphones
5.	Four digital audio recorders
6.	Six studio lighting units

",Community Youth Leadership Training in the Eastern City of Darna,"
The Humanitarian Forum is an International NGO with a local chapter in Libya that is currently engaged with dozens of communities and organizations throughout the country.  It’s trustees represent a broad spectrum of international actors, including Islamic Relief, the British Red Cross, Oxfam, the International Business Leaders Forum, and the World Assembly of Islamic Youth, among others. The forum seeks to foster an empowering, mutually respectful, and safe environment for civil society to organize and act in defense of community interests.  

In the wake of Libya’s 17 February uprising, the Humanitarian Forum quickly established a local chapter, deploying full-time staff from the region and initiating humanitarian activities.  To date the Forum’s Libya chapter has implemented more than 10 successful programs involving hundreds of participants, more than 40% of whom were women.  These programs, which were implemented in communities large and small across eastern Libya, began with donor coordination and humanitarian services, and have since evolved to include a sophisticated series of civil-society development workshops. The proposed grant aims to continue this series of workshops, focusing specifically on youth actors in the cities and towns of eastern Libya, outside Benghazi.

The training workshops will be organized in units of 5 days delivered by Arabic speaking trainers from the Arab region mainly from Egypt, Jordan and Yemen.  Where possible Libyan co-trainers will be invited join Forum’s training team with the purpose of preparing a core team of Libyan trainers who can deliver similar trainings in the future.  

The overall workshop agenda will be as follows: 
Day 1: Setting the scene and understanding youth
Session 1: Expectations, workshop ground rules 
Session 2: Conceptual understandings of youth and young people
Session 3: Experiences of Libyan youth  
Session 4: Experiences of Libyan youth 

Day 2: Unpacking Community Development: Participation and Empowerment

Session 1: Civil Society and democratic processes, 
Session 2: Discussion continued 
Session 3: Youth roles in conflict and peace-building
Session 4: Impressions, concluding remarks and workshop evaluation

Young people represent the majority of the Libyan population.  For the country this represents an opportunity to harness the source of boundless energy and free thought that underwrote a revolution.  If ignored, however, or insufficiently integrated into Libya’s democratic transition, this same youth population could manifest as a serious threat to the country’s stability.  Now with a complicated mix of political, economic and social movements, Libya’s transition requires civil-society stakeholders to capitalize on opportunities; and in particular it requires them to harness the energies and talents of young people who are eager to move the country toward freedom and democracy. 
 
THF aims to support youth civic engagement initiatives and to develop the capacities and skills of young community leaders in cities and towns of East Libya.  The Young Community Leadership workshop promotes organized volunteerism and leads young people to a better and more actionable understanding of civic responsibility.  The program seeks to turn the clock back on decades of isolation and oppression imposed on Libyan youth by the previous regime.  Creating opportunities for young people to take the lead as responsible citizens in the democratization of their communities will eventually give rise to proactive agents of social change in the free Libya.

In partnership with a Libyan youth organization, this activity will help educate the Libyan populace about the transition and upcoming political processes.  The grant is funding the mass production of an illustrated booklet containing the basic concepts of democracy and civic participation, which will be distributed through future workshops and civic education campaigns, and through local CSOs based in around Benghazi and beyond.  The booklet will address the understanding of core democratic principles and values, thebasic rules of democracy, and the relation of democracy and Islam.  USAID/OTI is designing the manual in partnerships with Tajama Shabab, a Benghazi-based NGO headed by a young, English/Arabic-speaking activist named Tamer Mohammed al-Jehani.  The organization was founded on 28 February, 2011, just days after the beginning of the 17 February uprising in eastern Libya.

",Understanding Democracy - A Civics Manual for All Libyans,"
Tajama Shabab a local NGO headed by a young, English/Arabic-speaking activist named Tamer Mohammed al-Jehani.  The organization was founded on 28 February, 2011. 
 
Tajama Shabab is a Benghazi-based organization of young democratic activists that formed just days after the 17 February uprising in eastern Libya.  Members of the organization have united under a creed that Libya’s successful transition to democracy will not come unless all of society can be made to understand and adhere to the fundamental concepts of democratic governance.  Since its establishment the NGO, with members from across the cities and towns of eastern Libya, has been active in promoting these concepts in both formal and informal contexts.  An early demonstration of the group’s organizational strength came on 27 July 2011 when, together with a bevy of similarly motivated organizations, Tajama Shebab hosted a National Dialogue Forum.  Weeks before the fall of Tripoli and the ouster of Mu’ammar Qadhafi, The Forum challenged dozens of participants to imagine the discreet characteristics of a future Libya in which democratic institutions would take shape and begin implementing the principles of the revolution.  
 
As the surrounding political context in Libya has evolved, so too has the mission of Tajama Libya.  Having witnessed and participated in a period of concerted engagement directed at urban elites, the organization has now identified a special need to extend the discussion about Libyan democracy further into society, especially among marginal constituencies that may yet harbor feelings of distrust and suspicion with respect to the revolution itself.  Roughly 25% of Libya’s population is classified as rural, and another 20% are thought to be illiterate.  The literacy rate drops further if you take into account the preponderance of localized and colloquial dialects that hinder a person’s access to what now constitutes the “published” dialogue.  
 
This project aims to meet the twin needs of access and cultural sensitivity for that part of Libyan society that has been peripheral to the many conversations about democratic transition.  

Tajama Shebab, in conjunction with DAI, OTI, and a range of Libyan individuals and organizations that have offered their support, will publish a booklet that speaks in simple terms to some of the most important hopes and anxieties of the general population as it undergoes transition.  To accomplish this the booklet will deploy a variety of instruments and techniques, including: pictorial representations of key democratic concepts, institutions, and processes; and the use of dialect and colloquial language to articulate key messages.

The booklet will constitute 24 pages of text and drawings.  Work on the pamphlet will be undertaken by two groups of contributors.  For the text itself, Mr Tamer, the director of Tajama Shebab, will serve as the editor-in-chief of a writing/translation team drawn from the organization.  Another group of contributors will generate the artistic backbone of the pamphlet, working under the guidance of a chief graphic designer.  Together these groups will also consult with a range of outside experts as the material takes shape - including highly respected Libyan academics in the fields of law, political science, and human rights.  The group will also draw inspiration from similar OTI products that have been produced elsewhere in the world, including Bolivia and the Sudan.

As a whole, the group will work to produce a coordinated set of texts and images that will come together in a final, bookletized publication.  A draft will be submitted for official review by 14 November, and the grant will then fund local printing of the final product, which will take place prior to 26 November.   Approximately 15,000 copies of the booklet will be produced.  Tajama Shebab will submit the print-run to OTI so that distribution of the material can be coordinated with a broad representation of civil society, and managed according to changing facts on the ground.

",Civil Society Media and Communications Training in Eastern Libya,"
Established in September, 2011, the Benghazi Civil Society Resource Center, or Hamzat Wasl, is intended as a focal point for the activities of non-governmental organizations throughout eastern Libya.  The Center closely collaborates with subject matter experts employed by Mercy Corps and other international organizations working in Benghazi.  Through these international advisors, as well as Libyan professional staff, IT resources, and other forms of support, the Center aims to build the management and advocacy capacity of local civil society organizations, and to encourage CSOs to work together in pursuit of common causes.  

With Hamzat Wasl as a focal point - utilizing audio-video equipment recently acquired by the Center - this project will provide technical media training for members of Civil Society organizations based in Eastern Libya.  ""Reconciliation"" will serve as the theme for a training course that will culminate in the production and exhibition of photo and film projects completed by the trainees.  

Sixteen individuals will participate in the week-long training event. The trainings will consist of four seminars, each focusing on a different component of media production that organizations can use for the benefit of advocacy campaigns. Participants will be divided into groups, and each group will work throughout the week to produce either a photographic or film exhibition.  The exhibitions will then display at Hamzat Wasl for viewing by other CSOs, the donor community, and the general public.

In their productions, trainees will be encouraged to explore the theme of reconciliation as it pertains to conflicting interest groups in Libyan society. Trainers will lead participants through a theoretical overview of how media is used in civil society and how media has been used to promote reconciliation. The course will also be structured around a practical introduction to the tools of digital photo and film production. 

The first day of seminar will be split into two workshops. The first workshop will give an overview of media and civil society and begin helping participants narrow their focus and objectives for the project. Participants will receive a wider understanding of how media influences public discourse and how different media can be used to access different audiences. Participating in this discussion will be Dr. Hana al-Gallal, Director of the Libyan Center for the Development of Human Rights.  Dr. Gallal will present a general overview of reconciliation as a theme for advocacy, as well as some of the specific ways in which reconciliation might be imagined and promoted. The talk will conclude with examples of how media has been used to promote reconciliation between divided societies.

The second day a guest speaker will introduce the concept of strategic communications. The guest speaker will be a highly regarded communications expert with several years of field-experience, communicating messages to audiences in an international context.  For the day’s afternoon session participants will be dividing into two sections. The first section will take participants interested in producing photographic exhibitions and the second section will take those who choose to work on short films.  Groups will work together and with specialists to define their topic and to develop communication strategies. Both sections will then receive a ""how to"" with equipment and an overview of the aesthetics of photography and film. The photography seminar will highlight symmetry, composition and rule of thirds.  The seminar for film will cover editing, the 180-rule, and quality sound recording. Both will be followed by a technical overview of how the respective equipment functions.  

The third day of seminar will also be divided into separate sections devoted to photography and film. Both sections will be a tutorial in post-production techniques. For photography this will focus on importing images and processing them for final production. It will include basic cropping, color correction, and preparing images from print. For the groups working on short films this seminar will focus on importing footage, basic editing techniques, and sequencing of footage. 

The fourth day and final seminar will focus on print photographs, installation, and exporting film to DVD. This seminar will also be split. The photography group will finalize the gallery space and prints for the photo exhibit. The short film groups will learn how to export and burn their project to DVD and set up a viewing area for the screening of their short films. The seminar will conclude with a brief overview of other forms of media communications and dissemination, including web, print, and new media.

A documentary or media production will be shown during the evening of each seminar day. The films will exemplify how media can be used to promote reconciliation. The films will both give participants examples of how other directors have approached the topic of reconciliation and they will give participants an opportunity to see how professionals put the technical skills covered by the seminar into practice. Participants’ attendance will be optional for the film screenings but their presence will be encouraged due to the contextual benefit the films will offer their final projects. The films will be shown at Hamzat Wasl.

The workshop, in coordination with Hamzat Wasl, will host an open-house gallery evening to share groups’ final projects with the larger community.

Since the uprising in February 2011, and the liberation of the country, there has been an explosion of new and independent media. A significant characteristic of all the newly emerged media personnel is that the majority do not have a media or communications background and need to develop a better understanding of independent media and the role it plays in an open society. Media in Tripoli has made extraordinary, however tenuous, gains in a very limited period of time. This activity aims to establish a baseline of quality content at select print and radio media in Benghazi through a baseline assessment of 4-6 media outlets in Benghazi and develop a cadre of journalists at 1-2 selected media outlets in Benghazi equipped with the skills to produce high quality and professional media programs addressing issues of importance to Libya during this critical transition.

",Building Blocks in Media: Journalist Training and Improving Content in Benghazi,"
During the reign of Muammar Qadhafi, Libya was rated as one of the least free countries in the Arab region – especially in terms of freedom of expression and open media. Since the uprising in February 2011, and the liberation of the country, there has been an explosion of new and independent media. As of July 2011, about 120 publications, five radio stations and three-to-five TV stations are now on the street and in the air, according to the Media Communication Committee (MCC) - the media arm of the National Transitional Council.

A significant characteristic of all the newly emerged media personnel is that the majority do not have a media or communications background – they are students of other professions (engineers, doctors, dentists, students etc.). Many left their jobs or course of study when the revolution began – and most do expect to go back one day. However, they have identified a need in their communities for free and accurate information and they are proactively making it happen. Thus, very few of them have a clear picture of their future in media and a majority of those who are currently reporting may not continue to do so when stable conditions are re-established in Libya. Thus, it is safe to assume that there will be a considerable decline in the number of media outlets since the revolution is near over. 

Amongst the challenges facing new and upcoming media in Libya is clearly the lack of professional journalistic skills, the lack of funding and the lack of knowledge of concrete business models, which will keep new media outlets afloat in the long term. Some media actors during Internews’ assessments also highlighted the lack of an independent printing facility as a challenge as well as a fear of the old mentality and regime manifesting itself in media.

The Libya uprising began February 2011, with many saying protests in Benghazi were initially sparked by the arrest of prominent lawyer and human rights activist, Fathi Terbil, on February 15th. Things quickly escalated and calls for a large-scale ‘Day of Rage’ on February 17th circulated via online social media networks.  Protests took place in the eastern city of Benghazi, as well as other eastern towns, and to a more limited extent in the West, where security measures were much tighter. Reports followed of government crackdowns and increasing resistance response, including the defection of several local army personnel. Protests and security reprisals were also reported in the country’s capital, Tripoli. By February 20th, Human Rights Watch estimated 233 people had been killed, a number which quickly rose. By early March, the uprising was claiming control of towns up to the eastern city of Brega, a short distance from Gaddafi’s hometown of Sirte.

Communications to the east, with infrastructure centralized in Tripoli, were cut, including internet, landline, and mobile phones. Misrata, in the west, also became similarly isolated. International journalists were harassed by the regime and its supporters, a number of them arrested; by late May five journalists were confirmed killed in the conflict. The rebels centered in Benghazi established the NTC, which first met on March 5th. This was initially set up not explicitly as an interim government, but explicitly to ‘provide an international face for the uprising;’ they aim to oversee a transition to liberal democracy. 

On March 29th, the NTC issued a ‘Vision Statement’, which served as a general ‘road-map’ for the establishment of a liberal democracy in the country. The use of the internet wasn’t the only major media factor; over the past decade, satellite TV has become increasingly prominent, with the rise of news stations like Al Jazeera, who have especially made an enormous change in media.  In fact, watching the coverage in neighboring uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia on these channels was commonly cited as having had a galvanizing effect on protestors in Libya.

Media in rebel-held areas and now in Tripoli have made extraordinary gains in a very limited period of time. Nevertheless many interlocutors spoke of the need to increase capacity with training and institutional assistance, whether through workshops and classes, mentorships, assistance in institutional development, or via relationships with broadcast and journalism institutions internationally. Limitations in media capacity take many forms. At the simplest level, Gaddafi’s regime seriously restricted the chances for journalists, editors, and students to develop critical and even practical skills. While senior or experienced former media workers do have significant talent, a number stated the need for further support and training, and the great majority of young journalists have received little, to no training at all.


This activity will be implemented by Internews. Internews is a globally recognized leader in the implementation of media development and development public communications activities in post-conflict and security challenged environments. 

The media outlets that the Internews assessment team spoke with in May and June 2011 all identified themselves as ‘supporting the revolution’. They defined their roles as explicitly countering Gaddafi regime propaganda, urging former Gaddafi supporters to join the revolution, recognizing and honoring those killed in the fighting and their families and motivating the public to continue to support the revolution. However in their avowed support of the revolution, the line between independent reporting and promoting the revolution is often blurred. 

It is apparent that emerging media outlets lack the proper training, professionalism and grounding in media ethics. Internews envisions helping develop a better understanding of independent media and the role it plays in an open society. In order to support the local media’s mission to inform the outside world about events in Libya and educating Libyans about political transitions and processes, Internews has compiled the urgent needs of local media outlets in Libya. These include:

1. 	A need for media to become more professional: basic journalistic skills, awareness of journalistic standards and ethics, and financially sustainable business model
2.	 Build an institutional framework for future trainings and a strategic move to professional journalism of the media which also ensures local ownership
3.	 Need for equipment and technical support for outlets
4.	 Need for support to the new independent media and media activists to organize themselves, and build frameworks for future co-operation. 

The rapidly evolving situation on the ground, along with the transitory nature of current regulatory and political structures requires interventions to be designed to be flexible and responsive.  This means media support needs to be targeted and meeting current needs but without becoming locked into a limited number of relationships or assuming events will take one particular course. Activities must aim to meet several immediate and short-term goals, but also to facilitate broad relationships and input that allow Libyan media practitioners to engage in their own debates and set their own future directions.

",Reaching Out in Benghazi & the West: Rapid Information Dissemination,"
Since the liberation of the country in August 2011, severe tensions have occurred during the transition process. Many Libyans do not understand the basic vocabulary on the fundamentals of democracy, constitution making and elections. This lack of understanding inhibits effective and productive dialogue on transitional issues that are currently ongoing in the country. Also by not understanding these issues, the population, especially youth and civil society, are constrained in their contributions and their ability to effectively participate in the process is weakened. Additionally, as civil society organizations have evolved out of the revolution, they often don’t have the capabilities to run effective workshops, organize outreach campaigns and design & develop messaging. Often, activity development takes a substantial amount of time and investment and cannot necessarily keep pace with the changes in the transition. 

As the draft of the electoral law has been submitted, the pace of the debate around the elections and constitution-making will increase. There is the need to have a quick and responsive mechanism that allows for the quick design and development of IEC materials, production and distribution of them. The Western part of the country is the future location of an office for the LTI project and often needs and local context make the western part of the country very different politically from the east. Though similar in nature to TRIP020, this activity will decentralize the responsiveness to the office in the west. 

The structure of this activity would allow USAID/OTI to quickly design, procure and/or distribute key documents and materials in support of Libya’s political transition and democracy as the needs are identified. These documents and materials will help to provide important information resources to the new civil society organizations, government representatives and/or the public at large.  

This activity aims to support the development, provision, and/or delivery of existing or new IEC materials on Libya’s transition and move towards democracy in addition to providing a flexible information dissemination mechanism for other stakeholders, as necessary. Subject matter can range from the re-production of local materials on subjects such as vocabulary of democracy, outreach campaigns, and the 20 month road map to international materials on constitution making, democracy, and restructuring of the state.

Subsequently, other grants will be cleared to implement the dissemination of the materials after selection of appropriate grantees. Similarly, existing networks will also be utilized to disseminate the materials through previous, current, or potential grantees.

USAID/OTI assumes that printing and disseminating IEC materials on the transition and democracy will help in creating an environment for public dialogue. This will result in stakeholders being pressured to continue to support the transition and democracy in Libya.

This activity will train civil society organizations from the eastern region on the official stages of the transition (the roadmap) so that they are equipped to hold more targeted trainings in their working areas. In August 2011, the Transitional National Council (TNC) released the Constitutional Charter for the Transitional Stage of which Article 30 outlines and defines the road map and ways forward during the transition process. In the eastern region, Libyan youth have demonstrated a sophisticated level of interest in how the transition occurs and what the end results will be.

",Beyond Booklets: Training Civil Society in Benghazi on the Transitional Roadmap,"
On October 23, the liberation of Libya was announced in Benghazi. In August 2011, the Transitional National Council (TNC) released the Constitutional Charter for the Transitional Stage and this document outlines the road map for this period. More specifically, Article 30 outlines and defines this way forward. A post-revolutionary Libya will be defined by complex social, political, and economic issues as the country moves towards the establishment of democratic governance. More fundamentally, democracy and transition are new terms in Libya and many Libyans do not understand the fundamentals of the transition period.

Youth played a pivotal role in the revolution and define a majority of the population in Libya. The median age of the country is approximately 24.5 years of age. Youth have become growingly frustrated with the new leadership for ignoring their input, dismissing their passion and taking for granted their support. In Tripoli, as elsewhere, Libyan youth have demonstrated a sophisticated level of interest in how the transition occurs and what the end results will be. Considering that youth constitute a formidable percentage of the population, there are many windows of opportunity for their empowerment and positive participation in this process. 

One such young group, H20, has identified that raising awareness around the TNC’s road map and generating an overall dialogue through information dissemination and outreach are needed in order for youth to engage in a more constructive dialogue on the next steps forward in the country. H20 is based in Tripoli and was founded by ten young individuals concerned about the transition process in their country and are supporting the positive contribution that youth can make during this process and the overall support that youth can provide in the development of an emerging democracy. They currently have a membership of 55 that is expanding with temporary office space in the capital. 

Under TRIP003, H2O has written and printed a booklet that outlines the transitional roadmap put forth by the Transitional Council. This booklet was developed to ensure that youth and the general public better understood the transitional process. The booklet depicts the transitional process as a 10-storey building built on the foundation of the revolution with each floor representing a critical milestone in the roadmap. 

This activity seeks to build on the foundation of TRIP003 by training 28 trainers from multiple civil society organizations on the details of the booklet and then deploying these organizations across the country to hold more workshops on the information included in the booklet. This activity assumes that by engaging youth and increasing their awareness on the country’s transition to a new government, they will be able to advance public expression and debate about the democratic transition.

",Voter Education through Videos and Street Campaigns in Eastern Libya,"
In mid-June 2012 Libyans are scheduled to vote in the first national elections in more than four decades. The outcome of this election will determine the members who will take the 200 seats in the National Assembly that will appoint the Constitution-drafting committee.

For the last couple of months state authorities have been busy organizing the elections, writing laws and regulations to hold them, and most recently mobilizing citizens to register in order to cast their vote on election day. The Election Commission has been struggling with the voter registration and voter education campaigns and getting timely and consistent information out to Libyans. This is a massive task and state capacity is limited and time is running out. USAID-OTI/Chemonics are well positioned to support the nascent Libyan civil society to play a more efficient role in reaching out to citizens through voter education public awareness activities to ensure the informed participation of the maximum number of citizens, including traditionally marginalized groups such as women, youth and the disabled. Additionally, the in-kind mechanism and flexibility of the LTI program is well suited to respond to rapid requests for support to information of key election information and processes.

Through this grant Chemonics/USAID-OTI will work with a Benghazi-based youth group, Bokra Youth Organization with the objective of raising awareness about the importance of registration for the National Congress elections as well as voting. The grantee will conduct a campaign on the importance of registering for the elections in two universities in Darna and Al Baida in Eastern Libya, targeting a total of 2000 college students. Youth make up more than 60 percentage of the Libyan population, and are therefore a critical group to target in the country’s transition to democracy to ensure their effective participation as informed and engaged citizens who will shape the future of their country.

",Libya Needs Your Vote! Outreach in Al-Wahat District and Tobruk,"
In June 2012, Libyans are scheduled to vote in the first national elections in more than four decades. The outcome of this election will determine the members who will take the 200 seats in the National Assembly that will appoint the Constitution-drafting committee.  For the last couple of weeks, state authorities have been busy organizing the voter registration and finalizing regulations to hold the election. Registration for the National Congress election finished on May 20th 2012 with 2,583,572 people registered to vote, which is 75.16% of the total of those who are eligible to vote.  

In eastern Libya, the National Election Commission has been struggling with voter education campaigns and getting timely and consistent information out to residents. This is a massive task with limited state capacity and time is running out. Therefore, some remote areas have not received enough information on voting and processes. USAID/OTI is well situated to support the emerging Libyan civil society to play a more efficient role in reaching out to citizens in remote areas through voter education public awareness activities to ensure the informed participation of the maximum number of citizens, including remote areas in eastern region of Libya and traditionally marginalized groups such as women, youth and the disabled. Additionally, the flexibility of the LTI program is well suited to support rapid requests for supporting information of key election education and processes. 

Through this grant USAID/OTI will assist local organization to reach remote areas, Arab - European Center for Human Rights and International Law (AECHRIL). Benghazi youth organization was founded in February 2011. AECHRIL has previously collaborated with the Norwegian Center for Human Rights on human rights documentation during the Libyan revolution period. Relatively, AECHRIL has established administrative system with records and trained staff. 

The group will conduct grant activities with the objective of raising awareness to emphasize the importance of voting for the National Congress election. They will also explain the voting techniques and procedures by engaging with people in public areas such as: bus stations, markets and the hospitals. The grant will target the total population in the Al-Wahat region, particularly three towns Awjilah, Jalu and Jakharrah.  These three towns represent three out of the five voting centers in the Alwahat electoral district. Furthermore, the grant will also target the total population in Tobruk, which represents one voting center in the electoral district of Al-Jabal Alkhdar region. 

Little, if any, voting education has been done in these remote areas due to them being tribal areas with ethnic tensions and that they are far from the larger cities. Centralized government has taken many resources from these areas while attention and resources are often largely focused on urban areas. This activity aims to target people in those areas to ensure their participation and engagement in shaping the future of their country. The grant will support the training of 35 participants from Alwahat region and Tobruk town each. The training will consist of voter education and outreach skills.  Those trainees will then conduct an outreach voter education campaign in Ujalu, Ujla. Ashkhara and Tobrog.   Moreover, the grant will support production and distribution of 10000 voter education brochures (2 different designs, 5000 each).

",Voter Education Workshop and Outreach Campaign (Go & Vote) for Greater Benghazi,"
On July 7, 2012 Libya will conduct its first national elections in more than four decades. The outcome of this election will determine the members who will take the 200 seats in the National Assembly that will appoint the Constitution-drafting committee. 

Benghazi is the most populated town in East Libya with approximately a population of 1,087,000 persons. Despite the controversial political debates concerning the legitimacy of the distribution of National Congress seats and the general perception that Benghazi is given fewer seats than it deserves, many people in Benghazi registered to vote in the National Congress election with hope of increasing Benghazi’s seats before the voting date.  The election date is approaching quickly but no decision has taken place to respond to Benghazi’s demand. Some of those disappointed people started calling on Benghazi’s citizens not to vote. 

Few Libyans have knowledge of or experience with democratic processes. A Benghazi based-organization, Libyan Organization for Development (LOD), will play a vital role in encouraging people in Benghazi and suburban Benghazi areas to vote. The grantee will urge citizens to vote in the national election by stressing the importance of giving equal rights to all Libyans in writing their constitution. LOD will play a leading role in promoting civic engagement in the greater area of Benghazi. Libyan Organization for Development was registered on 27th of May 2011 with 480 registered members.  LOD conducted several activities for example: training for 65 police officers focus on communication skills. In addition they led educational campaign to Sirt focus on reconciliation. Furthermore, they conducted workshop in Misratah focused on women's political participation. 
 
This activity will support a three-day voter education activity that includes a two one-day workshops that focus on training a total of 50 LOD members on voter education (25 members in every workshop). This will be followed by a one- day voter education campaign conducted by the 50 trained volunteers and supported by additional of 50 local volunteers from targeted villages. 

The grant will cover 10 villages around greater Benghazi; 6 villages in the east (Tookrah, Persis, bujirar, Almubana, Sidi Khalifa and Diryanah) and 4 villages in west (Saloog, Gimanis, Jirdenah and Al-Nawaigyiah). These areas will be targeted on this voter education campaign due to the high population density. Moreover, the grant will support production and distribution of 12,000 flyers (6,000 of 2 different flyers).

The main messages that will be shared during this interaction with the citizens include: 

1. Urging citizens to practice their citizenship right and vote. 
2. Explaining to the people why voting will protect Benghazi’s citizens’ rights in constitution writing.

",From East to West: Advocacy & Outreach Tools for Libyan Youth in the Transition,"
On July 7, 2012 Libya successfully and peacefully conducted its first national elections in more than four decades. This milestone determined the members who now occupy 200 seats in the National Assembly that is tasked with appointing the constitution-drafting committee. 

Libya’s youth feel excluded from the political development of their country. They wish to have a say in the drafting of the upcoming constitution, and in issues linked to governance and democratic transformation. They also want to have the chance to advocate for their rights in the constitution.

Knowledge of the Libyan youth is relatively limited on the constitution, national assembly and local governance. This has led to a lack of awareness on tools and methods of advocacy for legitimate rights to be included in the constitution, and a lack of knowledge on how these tools can be used when communicating with the national assembly or local government. 

Through this grant, Libyan Youth Movement (LYM) will play a vital role in encouraging Libyan youth to actively take part in important political processes and decisions during the transitional period by implementing two, three-day workshops targeting a total of 60 participants aged 18 to 35 and representing the following locations: Benghazi, Tripoli, Misrata, Ajdabia, Alkufra, Derna, Eas Lanof, Alberiqa, Albeida, Marj, Alwahat, Brega, Sousa, Sabha, Azzawiya, Western Mountains, Sibrata and Tobruk. 

Topics covered by the training will include: 

•	Political advocacy and outreach skills; 
•	Transitional processes; 
•	Constitutional drafting and constitutional processes; 
•	Local governance; and 
•	The role of the National Assembly. 
 
LYM is a non-governmental organization composed of over 200 registered members. LYM’s initial work during the revolution was in humanitarian aid. After the revolution they shifted their emphasis on raising the awareness of the Libyan public on civic participation during Libya’s transitional period. Their five-year strategy aims to build youth leadership for the future.
   
LYM works to encourage the active involvement of youth in society. Since February 28, 2011 LYM held several programs and activities, including conferences, workshops and open discussions targeting 80 university students and civil society members, and covering the themes of decision-making, self-development and positive thinking.  LYM also helped establish some foundations, such as Youth for Change and Alwafa Organization with other local NGOs.

On July 7, 2012 Libya successfully and peacefully conducted its first national elections in more than four decades. This milestone determined the members who now occupy 200 seats in the National Assembly that is tasked with appointing the constitution-drafting committee. 

The participation of Libyan women in the public sphere remains limited after the country’s revolution,
especially women outside the urban centers and more conservative and traditional suburbs. It is vital that Libyan women’s rights are fully included in future legislation and that they have the advocacy tools to guarantee that their voice reaches policy-makers, and that their needs are reflected in future laws and the upcoming constitution-building process.

Through this activity, the grantee the Libyan organization for protection of freedoms and Human Rights, will implement two, three-day advocacy workshops in Tripoli and Benghazi targeting a total of 60 women lawyers and judges, female legal councilors, and female academic experts in Sharia law. Members of the national media will be invited to ensure that the discussion and debates are shared with a larger audience. 

The objective is to review and discuss the legal framework of international human rights agreements relevant to women’s rights; and identify the gaps in Libya’s existing laws. This will then be used to lead discussions that will inform the participants’ feedback on Libya’s new constitution to ensure full respect and consideration for Libyan women’s rights. 

The committee to support women participation in Decision Making is a non-governmental organization which was founded in July 2011, namely for the development of legal, social and political rights of women, to ensure their right to effective participation in decision-making positions in the new Libya. The committee implemented a project between February 2012 and July 2012 aimed at voter education and also training female candidates and national election observers. In that project 14640 women and men in marginalized areas were direct beneficiaries in the voter education campaign, 1030 citizens participated in forums and seminars organized by the committee, 12000 young people were targeted in a voter education campaign in Benghazi University, 73 female candidates were trained in workshops and 66 election observers were trained around Libya. The committee also created a network of organizations working on activating the new draft of the transition Justice Law and is also working on recommendations to ensure women are involved in all mechanisms of transition Justice. The committee also participated with other organizations in organizing the international one voice conference that took place in Tripoli which addressed violence against women and women's participation in the constitution-drafting committee.

As Libyans observe Ramadan, it is a period of reflection and forgiveness and this time period provides an ideal opportunity for Libyans to reflect on reconciliation and transitional justice. Libyan citizens, authorities and civil society have limited exposure to transitional justice mechanisms, methods of national and local reconciliation, and conflict resolution tools. This activity will organize and conduct three movie nights during the month of Ramadan in Benghazi through the Arab-European Center for Human Rights and International Law (AECHRIL), a reputable HR organization based in Benghazi. The activity will target 90 participants and will focus on the themes of transitional justice, national reconciliation and conflict resolution in a number of countries including, South Africa, Peru, East Timor, and Morocco. Participants will be selected from Benghazi’s civil society organizations, politicians, general persecutors, members of the judiciary, lawyers, families of victims, tribal and religious leaders, journalists and TV stations and former brigade leaders.

",Reconciliation and Transitional Justice through Film and Documentaries,"
In the post-revolutionary period, Libya’s stability depends on the ability of the Libyan authorities and citizens to peacefully resolve conflicts amongst tribes that erupted as a result of pro-and anti Gaddafi loyalties during the revolution. As well as bring to justice those who committed violations against Libyans during the 42-year-old reign of Gaddafi, and during the revolution—whether through formal judicial processes or informal grassroots and traditional systems.  

Libyan citizens, authorities and civil society have limited exposure to transitional justice mechanisms, methods of national and local reconciliation and conflict resolution tools. This activity addresses this gap through the universal language of film and learning about these themes through exposure to the experience of other countries that went through mass human rights violations and conflict, such as South Africa, Peru, East Timor, and Morocco. 

Through this activity the grantee, AECHRIL will organize and conduct three movie nights during the month of Ramadan targeting a total of 90 participants and focusing on the themes of transitional justice, national reconciliation and conflict resolution from an international perspective. 

The screenings will be followed by a discussion and debate relevant to the theme of each screened film. Two experienced mediators will lead the discussion after each film screening (their biographies are in the implementation section below). 

Each film will target 30 participants who will be chosen based on the relevance of the topic to their personal and professional lives. Participants will include civil society members, lawyers, judges, families of victims, members of the national media/press, tribal and religious leaders, newly elected members of the National Congress, members from Benghazi’s local council and former brigade leaders.

AECHRIL is an international NGO that was founded in 2006 with headquarters in Norway and field offices in most of the Middle East and North Africa region. They have been operational in Libya since February 2011; and previously collaborated with the Norwegian Center for Human Rights on human rights documentation during the Libyan revolution. 

This is the grantee’s second activity with Chemonics/USAID-OTI. Under BENG007 they conducted two days of voter education and outreach training that targeted 35 individuals and a three-day outreach campaign in the Alwahat region that included the distribution of 10,000 voter education flyers.

Benghazi was the starting point of Libya’s revolution and people from the region see themselves as guarantors of the transition process. The Medical Faculty is the largest in Libya and is present in most university towns around the country and given it being the main political grouping outside of the Ghaddafi regimes own committees, the Student Union was publically persecuted by the regime in 1976 and it continues to represent a strong democratic voice for Libyan youth.

",Supporting the Student Union Election at the University of Benghazi,"
Generally, universities are the open platforms where the student will not only learn more about politics but get involved in politics. This involvement could be through debates, lectures and student elections. Student elections are an important in implanting the democratic behavior among the young generations; therefore a student election is an opportunity for students to practice democratic practices that will empower the democratic peaceful behavior.

Democratic political activities had been abandon in most of Libyan universities due to the incident that took place in April 1976, when Gaddafi regime publically persecuted members of the Medical Students Union who were suspected of opposing his regime and even executed some of them. Since then, there has been no student election until the medical students at the University of Benghazi held one in May 2012 
with 3,500-4,000 students taking part in the process, which was to elect a constituent body to draft the regulations and charter of the union. The Medical Student Union has proven to be very active in promoting reforms at the university, including engaging university management committees to address curriculum reform needs, push for better organization of the university and its activities and has staged peaceful demonstrations against a lack of professionalism among professors, who frequently either show up late or miss altogether scheduled lectures. The Benghazi University Medical Union is contact with its chapters at other universities to promote similar activities across the country. The Union’s general elections will be held on November 17, 2012. A 50-member committee comprised of 22 current union members and 38 university staff + professors are currently organizing the process. There will be a one week campaigning process beginning on November 10 with the election on the 17th.

In the eastern part of Libya, there are conflicting messages and lack of information on the aims of the constitution and what rights it will guarantee people. Additionally, there are unrealistic expectations that the constitution will solve the country's problems when in effect the constitution is a way to be sure that everyone – the government, communities, and individuals – has the same understanding of the organization and responsibilities of the government. This activity aims to support the training of 22 participants from seven key districts in the east on the substance of the constitution and subsequent processes in the lead-up to the referendum.

",Understanding Substance and Process in the Libyan Constitutional Process,"
There is fundamental lack of awareness and understanding of the basic principles of constitution-making and drafting in eastern region of Libya. This lack will impede the future political process in Libya, therefore a substantial effort is needed to fill this gap. Training of participants is designated to increase their capacity and means to reach out to the grassroots, fill this enormous gap and educate local NGOs, grassroots and governments officials in substance and process of the Libyan constitution.  

Despite the existing lack of constitution awareness, there are a number of trainers who conducted previous training and they are individual entity, local organization members, government officials. They have the capacity and willing to fill this gap if they will be granted by knowledge of constitution. Those men and women have played an active role in previous transitional process in their areas by conducting trainings and they are committed to make positive changes in their areas by supporting disseminating basic information and knowledge about constitution making process. However these groups need to be supported on information and obtain adequate knowledge on the substance of the constitution and subsequent process. 

USAID/OTI mechanism is designated to fill the gaps in transitional process and as well as to paved the road for sustainable civic education process, thus by conducting this training on the constitution, USAID/OTI will fill the gap of the local needs for domestic qualified trainers in constitution as well as  will enhance the long term sustainability of political education.

This activity seeks to promote the peace and productive reintegration of former revolutionaries (thuwar) by providing practical conflict mitigation training to local thuwar leaders from areas prone to instability that could derail Libya’s transition. In particular, this grant will support six three-day workshops in conflict resolution skills and non-violent communication techniques for 180 former brigade leaders selected and vetted by the Warrior Affairs Commission (WAC), who specifically requested this training to support ongoing reintegration efforts. The workshops will be held in Tripoli, Benghazi, Misrata, Gharyan, and Al Bayda, but thuwar from all regions will be invited to ensure inclusive participation. Thuwar have the potential to become catalytic change agents for conflict mitigation within their communities, and the WAC is a national institution that is a practical point of entry to engage this loosely organized but strategically critical group.

",Contributing Positively! Promoting Conflict Resolution & Reintegrating Thuwars,"
On October 29, 2011 the National Transitional Council (NTC) declared the establishment of the Warriors’ Affairs Commission (WAC) with the aim of registering in 30 offices around Libya all armed and non-armed fighters who fought in the revolution, and to build a comprehensive database with their contact information, technical skills and educational background. As of July 2012, WAC had registered 59,898 persons aged 18-24 and 60,740 aged 25-31. These individuals range from those who fought during the revolution (considered the real thuwar of which 20,015 have been registered) to those who participated in some degree or another during the revolution (both pro- and anti-revolution). 

The overall goal of WAC is to disarm and reintegrate these individuals either through skills/job training, further education or integration into the National Police and Army. Those who register to join the police or army, if part of the registration, drop out of the database. The reintegration effort is on an individual basis and not on a brigade basis as this approach should help diminish the power base of the brigades and ensure a transition to national security forces and the state taking more control and ownership of the responsibility for national security.  

Former revolutionaries are quick to distinguish themselves from those currently operating as security agents in katibas. Genuine revolutionaries, or thuwar, state that they took up arms for one purpose: to overthrow the Qadhafi regime. Some thuwar are hesitant to give up their arms until the government proves that they are capable of protecting the accomplishments of the revolution and will not allow the country to slide back into chaos. Others have turned in their weapons, and are in search of alternative livelihoods, while struggling with the psychological effects of war and a difficult employment environment. 

It is very important to engage former thuwar and finding positive ways for them to be productively engaged in their communities and the overall transition process. If they are not positively engaged, and coupled with continued ineffectiveness of the government and continually increasing disillusionment with the government’s credibility, then the WAC’s inability to reintegrate the former thuwar may threaten the stability of the transition process, and create space for opportunistic spoilers to manipulate grievances. 

LTI views the Warrior Affairs Commission as a strategic government partner and per several meetings with representatives of the WAC, conflict mitigation and non-violent communication skills training was identified as a practical way to support the provision of tangible benefits to disarmament while the WAC looks to transition former revolutionaries into other livelihoods programming. The effort of WAC to produce tangible and credible efforts in moving forward in their programming as continued delays may also hamper any further more substantive efforts on the part of the government to resolve the overall security issues currently facing the country. 

The LTI program aims to support WAC in training 180 former thuwar leaders (18+ years) through six three-day workshops in Benghazi, Tripoli, Misrata, Gharyan and Al Bayda,  pulling in leaders from across the country and will focus on conflict resolution and non-violent communication skills. It is expected that these leaders will be seen and act as change agents in their local communities. 

Selection of these locations is based on the fact that most brigades were formed in these areas during the revolution and they are either still considered high-tension areas or are surrounded by high-tension areas. Each workshop will have a total of 30 participants as follows: 

1 - Tripoli workshop: 20 participants from Tripoli, 2 from Bani Walid, 2 from Khums, 2 from Tarhunah, 2 from Garaboly and 2 from Al-Zawiyah.
2 - Benghazi workshop: 20 participants from Benghazi, 8 from Ajdabya and 2 from Kufra.
3 - Second Benghazi workshop: 10 participants from Sabah, Five from Awbari/Ash Shati, Five from Ras Lanouf/Brega and ten from Derna.
4 - 	Al Bayda Workshop: 20 from Al Bayda and 10 from Tobruk.
5 -	 Misrata workshop: 20 participants from Misrata, 5 from Zlitan and 5 from Misalata.
6 - Gharyan workshop: 10 participants from Gharyan, 3 from Nalut, 2 from Kabaw, 2 from Rujban, 2 from Jadou, 2 from Yefren, 5 from Zintan, 2 from Galaa and 2 from Kikla. 

A workshop was initially envisioned for Sabah however WAC cited security concerns in the region and members from Sabah, Awbari/Ash Shati will travel to Benghazi for the training. 

This activity assumes that by engaging former revolutionaries and increasing their ability to positively engage with communities, they will be able to transform the conflict or potential conflict in Libya in through peaceful means and promote public participation in Libya’s transition to democracy.

This grant seeks to empower people to participate in Libya’s political processes by providing applied training on how to identify, prioritize, and communicate community needs to local government in Benghazi. This activity will first train 28 key stakeholders from both the public and private sector in Benghazi and 2 members from the minstry of local governance on local strategic partnership techniques and communication skills, and then will use these skills to map needs in two districts and present the findings to the Benghazi Local Council (BLC). Located along Libya’s eastern coast, Benghazi was the epicenter of the revolution but its popularly elected local council has struggled to deliver services. The Multicultural Organization in Libyan Society (MOLS) is a local civil society group that can mobilize a broad spectrum of participants in Benghazi, where a crisis in confidence in local government is creating space for opportunistic spoilers to destabilize Libya’s transition.

",Bridging the Gap in Benghazi! Local Strategic Partnership Initiative,"
Following elections in July 2012 for the general national congress the new Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan was sworn in, in November 2012. The   ministry of local governance is in the process of passing clear local governance laws and ensuring fair distribution of power and resources between local councils.

There has been growing discontent in Benghazi and within the Benghazi Local Council (BLC) itself on the inability to provide basic support and services. Continued ineffectiveness, and continually increasing disillusionment with the GNC’s credibility, may threaten the stability of the transition process, and create space for opportunistic spoilers to manipulate grievances. Per a recent snapshot polling of Benghazi that was conducted by LTI in November 2012, only 31% of 306 participants agree that the BLC represents the wishes of the people. 

It is anticipated that that the BLC will soon receive a budget from Tripoli however the BLC is in need of quick and decisive activities and projects that highlight the BLC’s efforts to address service delivery. Due to the lack of strategic plans and transparent channels to distribute resources from the government at the national level, there has been a growing frustration particularly among communities in the east. To address this emerging frustration which may result in unrest, a more constructive and inclusive mechanism is needed. 

Libyan communities also require knowledge and mechanisms by which they can communicate community development needs and priorities to the elected local councils. 
Local strategic partnership initiative, LSPI is a mechanism in which important sectors in communities learn how to   unite and strategically identify and prioritize their needs and find a channel that addresses these needs in a peaceful manner to communicate them to local government. 

The LTI program aims to support the Multicultural organization in Libyan Society(MOLS) in conducting a 2-day workshop in Benghazi for 30 participants from various public and private sectors, key stakeholders in civil society, members of local committees and members of the ministry of local governance. The next step is then to support the grantee  in facilitating two needs mapping meetings in the two most established district committees in Benghazi.The two  district committees need to be established already and they are likely to be in stable areas as it is important to be able to measure the success of the needs mapping so we can build on it in the future in other areas in Benghazi.

The Multicultural organization in Libyan society was founded on Deecember 30th 2011 and it main objective is encouraging healthy interaction and dialogue between people of different cultures in Libya.
MOLS members have had previous training experience with common purpose on leadership skills and one of their founding members Nadia Gaouda became a subsequent trainer on leadership skills. During the elections the organization organized round-table discussions between civil society organizations and candidates. It also organized debates between different parties. Nadia Gaouda is a key political activist in Benghazi, often advocating for equal opportunities for citizens in the east through online petitions and many meetings with key officials in Benghazi including the Benghazi Local Council so through her activism she has formed many connections with key stakeholders in Benghazi. She was a volunteer on the survey  which was conducted by LTI in november 2012 so again herself and fellow members have a good perception  of community grievances in the city.

The inclusion of district committees in this activity is very important as Benghazi was divided into electoral districts in the local Benghazi elections in May 2012 and some districts formed committees following the elections based on this. Also currently meetings are being held between the Ministry of local governance and representatives of these districts in the Benghazi Local Council to try and establish the roles of districts in the functioning of the city as a whole.

The training will focus on local strategic partnership and developing cross-sectorial communication. The grantee initiated contact with two trainers from Brighton, UK who wish to begin a local strategic partnership initiative in Benghazi to develop cross sectorial communication to ensure that community needs and priorities reach community leaders in a way which guarantees tangible results.

This activity is part of an evolving cluster that aims to enhance the legitimacy and effectiveness of local government in Benghazi. LTI has already provided strategic communications training to the BLC (TRIP017) and is developing a grant to embed in the BLC a pair of short-term technical assistants (STTA) who will assist in the formulation and implementation of policy, administration, and management systems.  This activity will complement the cluster by providing practical tools for a broad spectrum of key stakeholders in Benghazi to more effectively feed into policy and form strong partnerships with local government.

",Taking Outreach and Discussions on the Constitution to the Local Level,"
In September 2011, Libya’s Transitional National Council released a Constitutional Charter for the Transitional Stage of the country’s democratic development and in July 2012 Libya successfully held its first democratic elections in more than four decades. The 200 members of the General National Congress that was consequently appointed were charged with appointing the Constitution-Drafting Committee to guide Libya through the constitutional-development process, although debate is ongoing as to whether the committee should be appointed or elected.

The manner of selecting committee members is but one of the uncertainties Libya is faced with regarding the constitution drafting process. Decisions are yet to be made regarding the role the public will play in this crucial process prior to the planned national referendum that will see a draft constitution adopted or rejected. The timeline for the constitution’s development is also uncertain, as is the extent to which the new constitution will incorporate elements of its pre-Gaddafi 1951 predecessor.

With so much uncertainty regarding the process by which the constitution will be developed, let alone its content, there is a need for factual, unbiased information presented in a readily accessible manner. This need is particularly great in eastern Libya, where tensions are already rising over key constitutional issues, such as federalism and control of state oil reserves. Providing information about the constitution-drafting process and various mechanisms for engagement will both promote stability during this crucial period in Libya’s political transition and provide communities with information needed to avail themselves of engagement mechanisms when these are presented as the constitution-drafting process develops.

Under BENG013 - Understanding Substance and Process in the Libyan Constitutional Process, LTI supported the training of 22 participants from seven key districts in the east on the substance of the constitution and subsequent processes in the lead-up to the referendum. The participants were able to obtain information on the constitution and develop a basic skills set in which they can train and/or conduct outreach campaigns in their communities while providing unique opportunity for Libyans to own these skills and promote this key transitional process and contribute to the sustainability of democratic education process.

Now, LTI looks to take the knowledge and skills learned from this training one step further. There is a gap in providing simple and basic information on constitutional concepts and process, and making such information accessible to the more unrepresented areas outside of Benghazi in key districts. This grant will focus on areas of Al Kufra, Tazirbu, Rabyanah, Aljaghbub, Ajdabiya, (Jalu& Awjilah) and Tobruk. Al Kufra, Tazirbu, Rabyanah are located in south Libya and surrounded by loose and un- demarcated territories between Egypt, Chad and Sudan. The disruption of informal patronage networks and the fragmentation of formal security services in these areas is accelerating the flow of weapons, goods, and human trafficking along the South's porous borders. Declining security and growing signs of extremism in the surrounding areas increase both the supply and demand for destabilizing illicit goods that are channeled through southern border towns like Kufra. 

Prolonged border closures and sustained military operations will impact powerful smuggling networks, depriving them of income and creating incentives for instability among spoilers. Due to the lack of  economic opportunities, some tribes in these areas have started to compete and seek control over the border to gain economic opportunities that may come with cross-border trade. This competition increases ethnic tensions and the continued fueling of the ethnic conflict between Zway and Tebu African tribes. 

The areas of Ajdabiya, Jalu & Awjilah are strategic areas for Libyan economic stability as they are areas of the biggest oil production and water reserves in Libya. These areas, together with Tobruk and Aljaghbub, are categorized with strong tribal influence and areas of illegal cross borders trade. There are some armed groups who were threatened the oil production several times during the past time demanding federalism and equal resource sharing.  As result, the area becomes fragile and potential for political rhetoric and ethnic monopolization and therefore for instability. 

The Forum for Active Citizenship and Libyan Democracy (FACLD) was an OTI grantee for TRIP022 in which the organization trained 341 NGOs members (157 women and 184 men) in elections observation and the principals of democracy. Its' mission is to teach Libyans, primarily members of civil society, the basics of democracy and the electoral process in particular. The Forum has a simple but highly interactive methodology for teaching small groups (less than 30) participants. FACLD has common potential about how to reach grass roots and address the civil society organization and communicate with them interactively thorough developed training material that will address most of concerns of grass roots and civil society organizations in southern Libya.

Within this fragile national identity structure and ethnic conflict, economic instability, the forthcoming constitution is an opportunity to unify Libyans by building strong constituency around the one constitution for all Libyans. This activity assumes that by engaging local governments’ officials, civil society, grass roots and other community members, increasing their awareness of the constitution-drafting process and providing them with opportunities to engage with communities, they will be able to advance public understanding of constitutional development processes and engagement opportunities, and thereby promote public participation in Libya’s transition to democracy.

In order to promote an inclusive constitutional process and to facilitate the process of Libyans arriving at peaceful and viable solutions to outstanding governance issues, this activity will provide key information to 60 members of the Pro-Decentralization Union, based in Benghazi, about the principles of decentralization and modes of governance in addition to anti-corruption and advocacy tools to feed into the constitution process. The Union’s members are employees of over 30 government entities such as the National Oil Company (NOC), Libyan Arab Airlines and the general electricity company and they have branches in Zwara, Al-Zawiyah, the Western Mountains, Awjilah, Jakharrah and Jalu. After the workshops, members will spread their newly acquired knowledge through an information dissemination campaign to fellow employees in their sector. Additionally, 20 core members will be those responsible for presenting a proposal on their vision of the future mode of governance in Libya to the constitution drafting committee.

",What does it All Mean? Understanding State Structures and Ways Forward in Libya,"
The drafting of Libya’s new constitution has the potential to serve as the foundation for reconciliation between communities and the establishment of a durable and democratic state.  This process is taking place, however, against the backdrop growing frustration with the current government, historic marginalization of certain cultural groups and regions under the m regime, and a lack of popular understanding of constitutional principles.  

Given this context, there are concerns that the failure of the government to carry out an inclusive and participatory popular consultations will increase, rather than decrease, insecurity in the country.  Thus, in the context of facilitating inclusive and effective political transition processes to address these issues, LTI’s constitutional assistance cluster will focus primarily on (1) increasing knowledge on constitutional issues and (2) providing increased opportunities for communication between citizens and the government.  While the below analysis addresses the current trends, core issues and potential triggers from a nation-wide perspective, its application to LTI’s constitutional programming will be contextualized by Libya’s regional dynamics and geographic priorities.  

Libya will shortly begin its constitution drafting process, one of the most important steps in the country’s political transition. Media and civil society discussions on the constitution center on Libya’s future state structure and what structures will help it move towards a fairer and more transparent administration system. There is increasing frustration in marginalized areas of Libya over perceptions of the unfair division of resources, lack of development and service delivery. Additionally, the topics of decentralization and federalism are getting bigger and bigger in many parts of the country. Continued ineffectiveness, and continually increasing disillusionment with the GNC’s credibility, may threaten the stability of the transition process, and create space for opportunistic spoilers to manipulate grievances.

It has become increasingly clear that the constitution will have to address, in some manner, the overall character of the state (unitary or federal).  Attempts to bypass this issue in the constitution – or a failure of the national government discuss decentralization outside of the constitutional framework – could lead to a rejection of the constitutional draft and possibly the government as a whole.

Libyans would be well served by engaging in inter-communal workshops and dialogues focused specifically on general information on decentralization, advocacy planning skills/tools to feed into the constitutional process and administrative governance at the local level, where mutually acceptable solutions could be identified and discussed are of paramount importance at this stage of the transition. Such workshops would allow a wide range of Libyans to engage in healthy and informed debates on specific governance structures which could in-return educe future demonstrations, recriminations, and the potential for violence in Libya.

The pro-decentralization union, which was formed on 21 June 2012, has identified that educating Libyans on state structures and different modes of governance will allow them to advocate in a peaceful and productive manner during the anticipated public consultations in the constitution-drafting process.

The Union has established branches in in Zwara, Al-Zawiyah, the Western Mountains, Awjilah, Jakharrah and Jalu where citizens are feeling the strain of the unfair division of resources and lack of opportunities available to the citizens. The Union has established good connections in these areas with the local workforce who have a strong influence on their communities and need to be educated on modes of governance in order for them to raise awareness on this issue to their fellow employees which would be a very positive step towards relieving tensions.

This activity aims to provide information regarding governance systems, centralization and decentralization to key members of the Union which they will need to peacefully put forward a proposal to the constitution-drafting committee of what they envision would be a fair mode of governance and to also disseminate information to fellow employees  on comparative governance structures and also provide them with tools they can use to peacefully advocate for their preferred outcomes during the constitution-drafting process.

In this activity, LTI will hold three workshops in Albayda targeting a total of 60 participants from Benghazi,  Al-Zawiyah, Zintan, Zwara, Albayda, Tripoli, alwahat, Derna and Sebha focusing on principles of decentralization and modes of governance in addition to anti-corruption and advocacy tools to feed into the constitution process. 20 of these participants will present a proposal to the constituent Assembly and all the participants will conduct an information dissemination campaign following the training. 

The workshops will be held in Albayda due to recent security developments in Benghazi mainly involving warnings to foreignors against all but essential travel to Benghazi.  This will not enable the international trainer to conduct the training in Benghazi so to ensure the trainers participation, the workshop will be held in Albayda.

This activity assumes that by providing information on governance systems and advocacy and the space for dialogue, participants will be better able to have their voices heard during the expected public consultations and it will also allow them to peacefully arrive at viable solutions in the libyan context.

Providing information about the constitution-drafting process and various mechanisms for engagement will both promote stability during this crucial period in Libya’s political transition and provide communities with information needed to avail themselves of engagement mechanisms when these are presented as the constitution-drafting process evolves.

LTI has supported several trainings of civil society and former revolutionary fighters from districts in the southern and eastern parts of Libya on the constitution and subsequent processes in the lead-up to the referendum. The participants were able to obtain information on the constitution and develop a basic skills set in which they can train and/or conduct outreach campaigns in their communities. As a next step, several organizations in each of these areas will begin their own outreach and information dissemination campaigns. 

With such uncertainty to the processes and timeline of the drafting process, the program may be required to respond quickly and effectively to address key gaps in information and it is possible that potential partners will have not been identified at the time however the development of the content in advance will be key to ensuring that this information is delivered in a timely manner. 

This activity aims to support the development, provision, and/or delivery of existing or new information, eductation and communication (IEC) materials on Libya’s constitution processes in addition to providing a flexible information dissemination mechanism. Subject matter can range from the basic vocabulary around the constitution and processes for the drafting phase to the role of civil society in the consultation process to the referendum in addition to international materials on constitution making, democracy, and restructuring of the state. This activity is similar to a previous DDGS (BENG002) that was used to procure IEC materal for the election.

Subsequently, other grants may be cleared to implement the dissemination of the materials after selection of appropriate grantees. Similarly, existing networks will also be utilized to disseminate the materials through previous, current, or potential grantees.

USAID/OTI assumes that supporting information dissemination during the constitution writing stage of the transition will help in creating an environment for public dialogue and thereby promote public participation in Libya’s transition to democracy.

A group of four civil society organizations led by the Libyan Humanitarian Aids Mission  (LHAM) will work together to host a one-day event in Benghazi that will feature speeches by an array of artists, writers, sports figures, and prominent local personalities. Located along Libya’s eastern coast, Benghazi was the epicenter of the revolution but has struggled to stabilize during the transition as a wave of targeted assassinations and expanding extremist influence have increasingly eroded security. This grant is a rapid response to rising concerns that the anniversary of Libya’s revolution may spark unrest, and it will help strengthen moderate voices in civil society to play an active role in promoting peace and security.

",Promoting a Peaceful Anniversary: Supporting Calls for Non-violence in Benghazi,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.

Libya's revolution started in Benghazi, and the largest city in eastern Libya is symbolic of the new transition's growing pains and security challenges. The Benghazi Local Council (BLC) is popularly elected but has struggled to deliver services. Government's slow pace in delivering tangible progress is creating a crisis of confidence in the transition and opening space for opportunistic spoilers to manipulate grievances. There has been a ongoing wave of targeted assassinations, primarily against members of security services who served under the Qadhafi regime, and there are increasing signs that the presence and influence of extremists is expanding. For example, Ansar al Sharia currently guards the east and west gates of the city, and continues to engage in a charity and charm offensive to capitalize on the government's weakness, win popular opinion, and recruit people to their cause. In January, the Italian consul in Benghazi survived an assassination attempt and the British government ordered its citizens to leave the city. 

A rapid response to an urgent request by civil society in Benghazi, this activity will support a one-day event that will gather prominent and popular community voices to advocate for non-violence on the eve of the second anniversary. There are growing concerns that the anniversary will catalyze and channel discontent with the transition into violence, and this activity seeks to strengthen moderate voices in civil society to take an active lead in pushing back against declining security trends. 100 community members will gather to hear speeches by local artists, writers, sports figures, and celebrities on the need for non-violence and the importance of peaceful dialogue. The event will be covered by three TV stations -- Libya Al Ahrar, Libya Alhura and Alasima -- to ensure that the messages are broadcast to a wide audience and have a broad reach. No individuals associated with formal or informal security services will attend the event. 

The Libyan Humanitarian Aids Mission (LHAM) is a national organization with an office in Benghazi and an established track record of conducting conflict mitigation activities in Libya. LHAM will lead a coalition of three other NGOs -- Rakha Development and Charity Foundation and Libyan Organization for Promoting Democracy and Freedom -- that will work together to host the event.

This grant aims to empower government officials, civil society, women and youth to acquire information and engage in dialogue about Libya's transition by creating a computer center with internet access.  This activity will establish a computer room with twelve desktop computers, a VSAT, and a year’s internet subscription at center locations provided by LHAM. The centers are located in Kufra (one a Zway neighborhood and one in a Tebu neighborhood) and one at Rabyanah for a total of three. Kufra is a large population hub in an isolated area of southeastern Libya. Kufra is important for the south stability and is home to marginalized Tebu. Rabyanah is also a second major area for marginalized Tebu group and is a center for smuggling from Chad. LHAM will manage the three centers and provide computer skills training to ensure that local citizens have a safe, culturally-acceptable space to connect with people, communicate about issues, and participate in the political process.

",Creating the Space for Debate: Supporting Information Centers - Kufra & Rabyanah,"
Since the liberation of the country in August 2011, severe tensions have occurred during the transition process. While the revolution opened Libya’s political space, after 42 years of repression, Libyans have little experience with political engagement and there is a lingering legacy of alienation. Many Libyans do not understand the basic vocabulary on the fundamentals of democracy, constitution making and elections. This lack of understanding inhibits effective and productive dialogue on transitional issues that are currently ongoing in the country. Also by not understanding these issues, the population, especially [target actor if relevant] and civil society, are constrained in their contributions and their ability to effectively participate in the process is weakened.

State presence has always been weak in the southern Libya, and Qadhafi never directly controlled the area. Instead of developing political and economic institutions to govern and secure the south, Qadhafi coopted powerful individuals and pitted ethnic groups against each through patronage networks.  The non-Arab Tebu were typically the losers in his game, creating strong, unresolved grievances around issues like loss of citizenship and lack of employment.  

Kufra is a central hub in Libya’s strategic periphery. The main city in the Southeast’s vast deserts, Kufra is a corridor for regional smuggling, a flashpoint for inter-ethnic conflict, and a significant source of oil. It is in remote area with small population, and strategic value mean due to the strategic location. The Qadhafi regime had to keep the region peaceful in order to secure its borders and access to resources, but also used all elements of its population as pawns in the wars it fought with Chad. That population is made up predominantly of two ethnic groups, the Tebu and Arabs. The town is highly polarized along these lines and conflict between the two groups has been a regular feature of life in Kufra in recent years. In February 2012 heavy fight took place between Zway and Tebu tribes and continued till they established ceasefire September 2012. 

As result of the fight, Kufra community is divided in two ethnic groups, Zway and Tebu tribes. Most of Kufra’s public services provision are located is located in the Zway areas and accessible to the Zway community only including the main hospital, Council’s offices, court, radio and police. Tebu are restricted at their main neighborhood of Hay Tebou (Al-Manara). It is located in the middle of the town and it is bounded by Zway neighborhoods. The neighborhood has limited access to government services and public utilities. Rabyanah is small town with around 600 households and is located 160km south west of Kufra, populated with marginalized Tebu tribe.

Libyan Tebu have never been effectively absorbed into the Libyan state or economy, and the combination of weak borders and strong ethnic bonds with other Tebu in Chad and Niger have made smuggling one of the few viable livelihood available. Cheap, state-subsidized goods from Libya could be exchanged for fuel, liquor, and other illicit goods from bordering countries. The supply of small arms and other weapons in Libya spiked during the revolution, and there are concerns that these are now seeping out of the south into the hands of extremists in surrounding states. 

The Libyan Humanitarian Aids Commission (LHAM) is a Libyan NGO that is playing the leading role in Kufra now in terms of monitoring and supporting the ceasefire there and also in supporting peace building programming. Currently it is represented inside Kufra by Walid Khalid, and also they have representative in Rabyanah. LHAM’s approach is to set up clear and mutually respected boundaries that allow both sides in Kufra to live in peace. They acknowledge that this does not promote integration but think that a period of peace and stability is the best way to create the environment that would enable that. LHAM plans to support its cease-fire committee mechanism with other activities such as local civil society training. Director of LHAM visited Rabyanah and acknowledge the political and economic marginalization for Tebu in Rabyanah.  LHAM appointed representative in Rabyanah, this representation aims reduce the sense of marginalization and to include the town in regional peace process.

This grant is part of a cluster of information technology centers that the Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) is supporting in order to empower civil society to access information, engage in debate, and participate in the political transition process.  LTI will establish three internet centers in Rabyanah and two in Kufra (one in a Zway neighborhood and another in a Tebu neighborhood. People who live in Rabyanah, Kufra  and surrounding towns, lack internet service and any electronic information or a place to meet and learn about constitutional processes, transitional justice and any other topic relates to the transitional period. By providing such service to LHAM will create a space that will assist key local partners to develop skills and tools necessary to mobilize advocacy networks, meaningfully engage in political processes, and monitor the transition’s progress with a particular focus on traditionally marginalized constituencies (e.g. women, youth, minority groups, and southern regions).

LTI plans to promote sustainability of the center by hiring an STTA who will work with the grantee to develop a business model to maintain internet connection costs. Since LTI hopes to replicate this type of civil society-internet center arrangement in multiple areas, this technical expertise is planned to be hired through a separate STTA rather than as a budget line for this individual grant. Additionally, LTI is looking at bringing in other STTAs to provide additional advocacy skills and online media training to help civil society more effectively use the computer center as an advocacy platform. 

The assumption behind this activity is that increased access to information and skills will contribute to Libyans playing a more active role in the transitional processes. By empowering people to learn about the constitution, women’s rights, reconciliation, transitional justice and other related transition issues through IT and the center, this will facilitate discussions and dialogue around the constitution drafting period. The center will function as a medium for people to gather and learn about political issues and the center will be accessible for Kufra and Rabyanah.

In order to strengthen the capacity of Libyan civil society to counteract increasingly strong, yet minority extremist groups, this activity will provide technical insights and networking opportunities for a female Libyan activist from Benghazi. In particular, the grant will provide logistical support for the activist to attend a regional workshop in Dakar on civil society experiences and approaches to promoting moderate voices and countering violent extremism. As evident with the September 11 attack on the U.S. consulate, Benghazi has increasingly come under attack by extremist minority groups that are attempting to undermine Libyan government authority, increase their own legitimacy and gain recruits. Activists are working to counter these attempts, including the participant in this activity.

",Supporting Activism and Moderate Voices: Regional Workshop in Dakar,"
With a high per capita income, relative social cohesion and a strong motivation among the majority of the population to have a successful transition to democracy, Libya’s political transition is widely considered to have a high potential for success. However, with weak security institutions, inexperience and lack of established democratic governance structures and social issues left over from the Qaddafi regime and brought to a head during the revolution the situation in Libya remains fragile. 

A small group of well organized, extremists are taking advantage of the government’s inability to produce practical and visible improvements in security and development at the community level to delegitimize the government, gain support and recruit in vulnerable communities, particularly in Benghazi and the East in general. 

After the revolution, and particularly over the course of 2012 these extremists conducted a series of escalating attacks on the international community, culminating in the attack on the U.S. consulate on September 11, 2012 and the death of the U.S. Ambassador and other Embassy staff. This campaign led to the withdrawal of the international community from Benghazi, and an initial backlash by civil society against the extremists, which temporarily forced them to leave Benghazi.  Since this time, extremist groups have returned to Benghazi and have launched a wide range of social media campaigns, and provided security and social services where the government has proven unable to do so. These efforts have been very targeted at communities and neighborhoods around Libya that are most vulnerable to recruitment due to poverty, insecurity, past abuses and lack of effective government presence in general. 

Women’s rights have been particularly affected by the increased presence and authority of these violent extremist groups. Although a small fraction of the population, through particular incidents and campaigns, they have been effective in creating an atmosphere in which women no longer feel safe in many social situations. For example, recently a woman activist was aggressively harassed by a taxi driver for not wearing a hijab. Word of this incident spread and many women now feel like they are not safe taking taxis unless they know the driver well. In places like Derna, in eastern Libya there is a defacto ban on women being able to take taxis. Additionally, there have been numerous reports of cases where women drivers who do not wear the hijab are bumped and pushed off the road by violent extremists.  

The Libyan government at various levels, along with civil society has informally articulated a joint campaign to counteract extremists and to promote national unity in Libya. It will take considerable more time for formal security forces to prove effective and for local government to effectively provide the social services that communities expect. Therefore, the general vulnerability to extremist groups will remain in the short run making the transition fragile. 

This activity will provide the opportunity for one women’s activist in Benghazi to participate in a regional workshop in Senegal May 4-10 to learn experiences and techniques for implementing campaigns that support moderate voices and counter violent extremism. The activist was selected due to her proven track record, reputation and large social network in the east and her desire to use the information gained to launch practical campaigns in Libya upon her return. The Benghazi activist will compliment another Tripoli-based women’s activist that is being supported by the International Republican Institute to attend the same workshop. Together, they have networks that span across Libya and therefore could share ideas, coordinate and launch joint campaigns upon their return.  In particular, the activity will provide airfare, lodging and meals and incidental per diem for the Benghazi activist while she participates in the workshop.

This activity seeks to strengthen local government and support moderate voices by revitalizing a soccer field and creating an active community space in the underdeveloped and volatile eastern city of Derna. This grant will enable the Derna Local Council (DLC) to complete the rehabilitation of a derelict soccer field by providing artificial grass, seating benches, four flood lights in addition to fencing and poles to protect the field as well as 2000 sticky posters to be distributed around the city at the time of the field launch. Derna is a conservative religious city with a deep history of distrust towards government among a disconnected community prone to extremist influence. The soccer field and surrounding grounds are a quick-impact project that provide a space for youth engagement and women to interact, and will help build community confidence that the DLC can responsively deliver tangible benefits.

",Goooooal! Supporting Moderate Voices in Derna thru Open Spaces,"
The Libyan government’s slow pace in delivering security and service is creating a crisis of confidence in the transition and opening space for opportunistic spoilers to manipulate grievances. The problem is particularly acute in Derna, a conservative religious city with a legacy of distrust towards government and extremism (est. population of 180,000). During the Qadhafi regime, Derna was the base of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) and the port through which most Libyan jihadis passed on their way to Afghanistan and Iraq. After the war in Afghanistan ended, returning LIFG fighters set their sights on toppling the Qadhafi government and launched a failed rebellion. Qadhafi responded with a brutal crackdown that collectively punished the citizens of Derna, destroying development and exacerbating grievances that continue to be exploited by extremists such as Ansar al Sharia. 

The Derna Local Council (DLC) is composed of 23 members who were elected on July 17, 2012. Ten members represent the city center, and 13 represent the surrounding communities. Since being popularly elected, the Council has attempted to initiate a number of community development projects, including construction, water pumping, road paving, and the delivery of medical supplies. However, the Ministry of Local Government (MoLG) is currently only providing limited, restricted funding to local councils until the Local Administration Law is activated, and the DLC has had minimal success in attracting outside investment given the volatile security environment. As a moderate voice in the city, the DLC is playing an active role in facilitating community dialogues with a range of local stakeholders addressing both security and development issues. Moreover, the DLC arranged for both civic and social community leaders access to national government representatives.

This soccer field and community space are a small scale, high impact, catalytic activity to boost activity in Derna and build confidence that local government can provide tangible dividends during the transition period. It is temporary, gap-filling support intended to help the DLC be more active in providing community benefits until the DLC receives consistent and adequate funding from the central government in Tripoli. While the main partner is the DLC, there will be active collaboration between the DLC, the managing member of the al-Najoub sports club, and the surrounding community of Bab Toburk. Local youth have also expressed a strong desire to contribute to the completion of the new field. 

The soccer field is located in Bab Tobruk, a neighborhood within Bumansour district which is considered one of the safest locations in Derna. The field is centrally located near the DLC offices, the Omar al- Moktar Medical University (Derna Campus),  a Medical Technical  School, Derna's Central Hospital (currently undergoing construction), and three public schools for boys and girls of different age groups. The DLC recently cleared and leveled the overgrown field, and is seeking support to complete the project. In particular, this grant will provide: (a) artificial turf to cover the new playing surface; (b) seating benches for people to attend events; (c) fencing material; and (d) lighting. Artificial turf is typically used for soccer fields because it is more sustainable in Libya's harsh environment and it is more easily maintainable for a local government with limited resources. 

The soccer field will create a public forum to engage two key groups in Derna – youth and women. The management team of the al-Najoub sports club is planning to designate two days a week for specific women activities at the soccer field. Lacking economic opportunities and alienated from the state, Derna is filled with a deep pool of disaffected youth who turn to crime, drugs, or extremism.  Additionally, there are few places in the religiously conservative city for women to come together. By providing a community space to bring their children, the field and surrounding grounds will be particularly beneficial in providing a safe space for women to interact. Finally, by attracting large groups of people in a small city with few options for entertainment, the soccer field provides a platform for future information dissemination and outreach activities.

This activity assumes that creating an active social space for youth, women, and other community members to interact will help create positive momentum in Derna that fosters peaceful linkages among the community, builds trust between the community and local government, and reduces the opportunity for extremists to gain support.

",Revitalizing Community Spaces: The Derna al-Zahera Campaign,"
The Libyan government’s slow pace in delivering security and service is creating a crisis of confidence in the transition and opening space for opportunistic spoilers to manipulate grievances. The problem is particularly acute in Derna, a conservative religious city with a legacy of distrust towards government and extremism (est. population of 108,000). During the Qadhafi regime, Derna was the base of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) and the port through which most Libyan jihadis passed on their way to Afghanistan and Iraq.

Recently the DLC is playing a more active role in facilitating community dialogues with a range of local stakeholders in order to address security and development issues.

Strong moderate voices in form of community leaders and civil society organizations have also taken a lead role in Derna to improve the quality of life in the city. These moderate voices include Derna Businessmen Club, Derna Cultural Center, College of Agriculture and Boy Scotts of Derna among others have all played an active role with Derna al-Zehera (""Beautiful Derna"") campaign to improve the quality of life in Derna and to support local communities. The campaign began in February 2013, with campaign members actively networking with both governmental and non-governmental organizations and in implementing revitalization work on four community spaces; cleaning, planting trees and flowers as well as installing lighting and irrigation systems. Neighbors of each target community space also contributed and have since maintained the sites by cleaning and watering the plants. Derna al-Zehera campaign encourages all community members to participate.

The Derna al-Zehera campaign has received a lot of praise locally and carefully selected its target locations. For instance, the street facing the Library of King Idris (under renovation) has had some the building walls repainted and fruit trees and flowers planted along its pavement making an enjoyable walk for pedestrians. Another very small public garden was also target by the campaign providing a spot for locals to mingle in very pleasant and cool surroundings. 

The DLC in collaboration with Derna al-Zehera campaign volunteer members will mount 120 garbage bins across some of Derna’s streets and community spaces. The public work company has committed to pick up garbage on a regular basis. Additionally two community spaces will be revitalized; cleaning, painting, planting of trees and flowers as well as adding children’s playground equipment. The first site is adjacent to Derna’s main commercial and shopping street, while the second is along the seafront where local families tend to enjoy the cool sea breeze during hot summer nights. Derna al-Zehera volunteer members will also launch an outreach campaign that will include posting two billboards, distribution of leaflets and stick posters advocating city residents to protect public property and support the rule of law. USAID/OTI will provide (1) 120 garbage bins, (2) Park lights, (3) posters and leaflets and (4) six sets of children’s playground game equipment. 

This mounting of 120 garbage bins across Derna, revitalization of community spaces and campaign are a small scale, high impact, catalytic activity to boost activity in Derna and build confidence that local government can provide tangible dividends during the transition period. It is temporary, gap-filling support intended to help the DLC be more active in providing community benefits until the DLC receives consistent and adequate funding from the central government in Tripoli. While the main partner is the DLC, there will be active collaboration between the DLC, the members of Derna al-Zehera campaign, and the surrounding community of community space. Local community members have also expressed a strong desire to contribute to the Derna al-Zehera campaign.  

The campaign will allow locals to see firsthand what little effort can do in improving their community streets and spaces as well as encourage them not to wait for things to happen but to take the lead in improving the quality of their lives. Lacking economic opportunities and alienated from the state, Derna is filled with a deep pool of disaffected youth who turn to crime, drugs, or extremism.  Additionally, there are few places in the religiously conservative city for women to come together.

This grant seeks to strengthen the credibility and effectiveness of the Benghazi Local Council (BLC) by supporting them to address the waste issue in Benghazi and reduce space for opportunistic spoilers to recruit discontented people to their cause. This activity will support the BLC to work with the Al-Basma civil society organization to deliver 200 garbage containers in seven key areas in Benghazi and also conduct an anti-litter outreach campaign by distributing 10,000 leaflets, placing 200 stickers on the containers, and posting 50 billboards throughout the city. Benghazi is the main city in the east and was the birthplace of the revolution, but the city has struggled to stabilize during the transition as a wave of targeted assassinations and expanding extremism has increasingly eroded security and public confidence in the transition. By addressing a widespread source of popular frustration, this visible and practical project will promote stability and counter the influence of spoilers by improving public perception of local government's responsiveness and effectiveness.

",Cleaning Up Benghazi: The Benghazi Local Council Anti- Litter Initiative,"
The Benghazi Local Council (BLC) was popularly elected in May 2012. Since then there has been a lack of clarity on whether the council’s role is legislative or executive and only in February the council received a budget which they have allocated for emergency expenses such as basic infrastructure. 

The BLC has struggled to implement visible projects with tangible dividends to the community, and as a result the citizens of Benghazi are getting increasingly frustrated at the lack of initiatives made by the BLC on the ground. This frustration has sparked frequent protests at the BLC offices. The lack of confidence has also begun to erode the credibility of the transition and create space for opportunistic spoilers to recruit discontented people to their cause. For example, Ansar al Sharia is already out in the streets trying to fill the local governance gap by delivering assistance.

Although, citizens in Benghazi have displayed their positive outlook towards having legitimate local governance in their extremely large turnout in the Benghazi local elections which was a total of approximately 75% of Benghazi citizens and it was also highlighted in the survey which was conducted under TRIP052 in November where approximately 85% percent of citizens believed that people genuinely supported the Local government. This all illustrates the general desire citizens have for their city to be represented and run by a legitimate local government regardless of the members.

Recently, one of the main sources of frustration, which is regularly highlighted on social media websites, is the large amount of waste on the streets and the fact that the BLC needs to have a clear environmental plan. Just recently the BLC environmental committee has ordered 1,000 medium-sized garbage containers to be distributed in Benghazi and has also liaised with the district committees in Benghazi to monitor trash-pick up by public and private companies and write up regular reports on this. 

The BLC however still needs support in mapping out simple initiatives which will address citizens’ grievances. This activity aims to support the BLC by distributing 200 medium-sized garbage containers in seven areas in Benghazi which are as follows: Al-Jamal St, Shuhada St, Lake area in City center, 23rd July Gardens, Al-Khaleej Street, Al-Salmani and Al-kish, These areas were chosen in particular because they have the most frequent visitors throughout the day and so the containers and environmental campaign will grab the desired attention needed for the success of this activity. 

Also coinciding with the distribution of the containers, LTI will support the BLC in conducting an anti-litter campaign which will involve the distribution of 10,000 leaflets, posting 50 billboards around Benghazi, and also placing stickers on the 200 garbage containers as part of a larger anti-littering campaign. All three mediums will contain messages that will grab the attention of citizens on the prevention of litter in the streets. 

Throughout this activity BLC will be coordinating with a Benghazi NGO called Al-Basma, which was formed in February of this year and has 17 official members. Since then they have coordinated with BLC in the maintenance of some of the main bridges in the city, they have also given humanitarian aid to unprivileged families and they have done active citizenship awareness in Benghazi University. Al-Basma's participation will include assisting in the design and dissemination of outreach material for the anti-litter outreach campaign. Al-Basma's involvement will also encourage a strong partnernship between civil society and local government. 

This activity assumes that distributing 200 garbage containers and conducting an anti-litter campaign will   improve public perception of the BLC's effectiveness and responsiveness.

This grant seeks to empower women by allowing people to understand and respect their role in Libya though the utilization of visual media. This activity will support attitude media group in the production of a short documentary (35-45 Minutes long), titled “Ambitious Woman”   by providing them with the necessary filming and production equipment and also support them in screening the documentary and conducting subsequent discussions. The documentary aims to highlight the contributions Libyan women made to the civil and political progression in Libyan history, during the revolution and also in the transitional period.  At a time when international conventions and national legislations in relation to women’s rights are causing controversy in Libya, lack of awareness from society on the importance of women’s full participation in the transition could destabilize the whole transitional period.

",Women Marking Their Spot: Documentary Highlighting Women’s Role in Libya,"
Benghazi was the birthplace of Libya’s revolution and is a symbol of the transition’s struggles. Targeted assassinations, calls for federalism, and expanding extremist influence are all symptomatic of underlying, unaddressed economic and political grievances. Women have played a key role in eastern Libya both pre-Qadhafi, during the revolution, and in the current transition phase. 

The GNC was elected in July 2012 with approximately 15% representation of women. Recently, the grand Mufti along with other religious clerks has made comments in relation to Libya’s adoption of the  Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) convention, arguing that it does not comply with sharia although other countries like Iran are assigned to it with the intention of removing articles which do not comply with sharia.

This debate has aroused heated discussions on national and social media and women and men who are supporting women’s rights have taken to the streets on several occasions in anger at the grand Mufti’s statements. But at the same time, there is a substantial percentage of the population that agrees with the Mufti.

At this time in Libya, it is imperative that the Libyan citizens understand and respect the role of women in the Libyan transition. The most effective means for getting a message across about women’s role to people and for instigating constructive dialogue is visual media. 

One group which understands the importance of visual media is the Attitude Media Group. Attitude Media Group is based in Benghazi and was formed in April 2011 with seven members. The vision of the founder, Murad Gargoum, was to document the Libyan revolution and then following the revolution they would continue to plan new projects. Amongst the group’s work is a short documentary on the role of the Benghazi pilots upon the entrance of Qadhafi troops on March 19, 2011 in Benghazi. Murad also won the prize for best documentary at the Benghazi Film festival in February 2013 for his short documentary on the first four days of the revolution in Benghazi before its liberation. 

This activity aims to provide the group with the necessary equipment to enable them to produce a documentary titled “Ambitious Woman” which will document the role of women before the Qadhafi regime, during the revolution and during the transition. It will include an interview with Al Nahdha women’s group, initially formed in Derna, which was a prominent CSO in the early 60’s up until the coup. The documentary will also include women who outlived the Qadhafi regime and also had the chance to actively participate in the revolution like NTC members such as Salwa Aldighly. Finally the documentary will include young women and teenage girls who had taken part actively in the revolution and are also taking part in the transition. This activity will also support the four screenings of the film at Benghazi University, Albayda University, CSO and political activists meeting center in Benghazi and the “AlFeel” cinema in Benghazi followed by a discussion surrounding the topic.

This activity assumes that by screening the “Ambitious Woman” documentary in key locations in Benghazi and Albayda and having discussions on the topic following the screening, it will spread the message that female participation in Libyan history and revolution was essential and that their role in the stability of the Libyan transition is of paramount importance.

",Right Eye: Supporting Eye on the GNC - Benghazi,"
In July 2012, Libyan voters flooded the polling stations all around the country, to participate in the first election to be held in over 40 years in Libya, a successful elections that resulted the formation of the 200 members General National Conference (GNC), the country’s legislative body that is tasked with the mission of steering Libya’s transition towards a constitutional democracy, the GNC was consequently responsible for forming a government, and guide the constitutional drafting process among other responsibilities.

Given the country’s recent history of dictatorship and authoritarian rule, there is a general lack of participation by citizens in the political process, there is also the absence of unbiased non-partisan source of information on the legislative activities and the transition process, which have resulted in widening the gap between the voters and the elected GNC, and lowering the public’s confidence in the implementation of the transitional road map.

“Eye on the GNC” is a joint project where both organizations Bokra and H20 work on observing and monitoring the national congress through reports which are released every 15 days for a period of one year, these reports and analysis included, though not always in each report, monitoring of the national congress, political parties and their reaction towards the progress of the national congress, the media and how it handles the ideas and points of view of the national congress and the political parties, the non-governmental organizations and their reaction towards the performance of the national conference and the political parties and how the Libyan street and the public reacts while signaling some events related to the subject. The team monitors forms of media including television and radio with these categories in mind. These reports include all laws, regulations, decisions and the data issued by the national congress including the views and visions of the political parties and the members of the national congress regarding these decisions and what comes along from debates.

Eye on the GNC: This activity aims at closing this gap by providing news and information on the legislative and parliamentary activities in a simplified and digestible manner, in the form of bi-weekly reports produced by H2O in partnership with BOKRA –a local NGO from Benghazi, these reports include Laws, Decisions, and data issued by the GNC, it also includes the views and reactions of political parties and members of the GNC. 

The proposed grantee, Bokra, has implemented many related activities funded by USAID/OTI and other donors, such as a voter education campaign through video and street campaigns. To date, Bokra, and H2O – its counterpart and partner in Tripoli, have completed nine reports and all of them are published on the Bokra Facebook https://www.facebook.com/Bokra.Org (currently with approximately 2,243 likes), http://www.bokra.org.ly/, and on the official web on the official site http://www.ignc.net.ly/.

This activity will support Bokra with equipment for monitoring and reporting of the GNC through the provisions of digital video recording equipment, V-Sat internet broadband with subscription, and will increase the report’s accessibility by sponsoring the online version on Facebook through advertising. An outreach campaign will consist of SMS text messaging support, advertising on billboards, and the printing of all published reports in the middle of grant duration (after 3-months) and at the end of grant duration, in form of A5 booklets. 5,000 copies [4,000 Arabic, 1,000 English]. The monthly reports will be printed in two bi-weekly newspapers in Benghazi. Almayadeen newspaper is published and distributed in Tripoli, Benghazi and Derna so it has a wide audience and is popular amongst readers. Alruiaa newspaper is widely read in Benghazi. Additionally, financial support (with 50% grantee contribution) will be provided to a project coordinator, three observers, one designer and one editor over a six month time period. 

The activity assumes that by providing such information, and by positively engaging in the political process as observers, it will help the general public gain valuable insight on the legislative process, and promote public participation in the transition.

",Securing Women's Representation in the Constitution Drafting Assembly,"
In September 2011, Libya’s Transitional National Council released a Constitutional Charter for the Transitional Stage of the country’s democratic development, and in July 2012 Libya successfully held its first democratic elections in more than four decades. 200 members of the General National Congress (GNC) were elected and charged with appointing the committee that will draft Libya’s new constitution.  After a period of stagnation that involved a long debate on whether the drafting committee should be appointed or elected, a final decision was made in early February to popularly elect the committee.  Therefore, on April 11, 2013 the GNC formed a committee to write the law for electing the Constitution Drafting Assembly. 

On May 28th, the committee presented the draft law to the GNC. The current draft doesn’t contain any special measures to ensure women's representation within the assembly. This contrary to the precedent set by the GNC election and international convention to which Libya is committed. During the national GNC election only one women was elected from the 120 individual constituencies, whereas special measures applied to the larger constituencies and resulted in the election of 32 women. Therefore, the fair representation of women will require special measures. The proposed electoral system will effectively exclude women from constitution drafting process. Women could be secured representation through special measures, either through a zipper list, quota, or other type of measures. Civil society advocates have generally focused on a quota as the most effective special measure. 

There is a fleeting window of opportunity for civil society to feed into the drafting of the Constitution Drafting Assembly election law, and this activity aims to support a rapid advocacy and outreach campaign by prominent activists to ensure equitable participation by including a quota for women the Constitution Drafting Assembly.  A one-day meeting in Benghazi will gather approximately 35 civil society leaders primarily from the eastern region (Benghazi, Bayda, Derna, Tobruk, etc.) to discuss the draft law, develop a consensus position, and issue a joint statement in support of a quota. Some of the attendees then will come to Tripoli and present their statement to the GNC. This statement will be immediately followed by a mass outreach campaign designed to reach a broad audience with basic advocacy messages. A Benghazi-based production company will create two campaign videos that will be broadcast on TV and posted on social media outlets (e.g. Facebook and YouTube). A version of the videos will be dubbed in the Amazigh language and played on an Amazigh television station if possible. Text message advertisement will also be purchased in order to push out campaign messages to 200,000 mobile phones. Finally, roughly 10,000 campaign posters will be produced and distributed through civil society networks. 

Legislators without Chains (LWC) is new local organization that established in December 2012 in Benghazi.  Members of the organization are comprised of individuals with legal backgrounds, lawyers, judges and law professors. LWC conducted a coordinated project with the UN and focused on civic education in addition to conducting one workshop training focus on the process of preparing for the Libyan repot of CEDAW which is supposed to be ready for submission on first quarter of 2014.  LWC is headed by Nisreen Amir who is a human right activist and consultant for the committee of human rights at the GNC. She also headed the Arab - European Center of Human Rights and International Law (AECHRIL), which was an LTI grantee for BENG007 and BENG011.   

This activity assumes that women’s participation in Libya’s transition is essential to the success and the sustainability of a democratic Libya and the well-being of all Libyans. This activity also assumes that while women in Libya have high levels of potential and capacity, it is important that their efforts be coordinated and focused to ensure women’s participation in the constitutional drafting committee.

",A Day at the Beach: Combining Clean-up with Constitutional Awareness,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Gadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government. After months of delay, the GNC has finally decreed the selection of the sixty-member drafting committee by popular vote; twenty members to represent each of Libya’s three territories, Tripoli, Cyrenaica and Fezzan. Although to date, many Libyans think the process of drafting of the constitution is unclear and the election date is unknown. 

Strong moderate voices in form of community leaders and civil society organizations have also taken a lead role in Benghazi to improve the quality of life in the city. Ayadina for Social Solidarity is a women’s group who is trying to present a moderate voice and leading peaceful community initiatives such as supporting unprivileged families in Benghazi with limit access to economic and social support. They are providing alternatives to the general public against more extremes groups taking advantage of the vacuum cause by the lack of local authorities ineffective implementation of cleaning campaigns and public works.

Ayadina initially started by focusing primarily on divorced women and large families collecting money from business leaders and the community at large to fund charity services providing clothing, stationary, computers and transportation services to both high school and university students in need of financial assistance. Ayadina also implemented training seminars on how to start a small home business as well as providing shelf space for the merchandise of these startups.  The goods include clothing, homemade sweets, spice mixes and traditional food products popular around Ramadan. In December 2012, Ayadina’s opened a small sewing factory employing thirteen women producing hospital and hotel bed sheets, patient gowns and robes. The project was partly funded by the Libyan Lending Fund LLF and a MEPI fund through the Community Driven Grant Program (CDGP). Another of Ayadina activities encourages housewives to become active within their communities by supporting them to participate in providing social behavior classes at local schools targeting children under twelve years as well as literacy courses for adults.

Recently Ayadina added cleanup campaigns to its programs. For the past four months every Saturday, Ayadina members targeted a neighborhood for a cleanup with neighbors spontaneously offering foods and drinks. These cleanup campaigns have also prompted comments from an Imam in certain districts of Benghazi to complain “today women are cleaning streets and men onlookers sounding flirtatious remarks.”  A youth group (non-members) of approximately 20 young men and women participate with Ayadina in these types of projects.

At this critical junction, Ayadina is planning activities to remind Libyans of the importance of engagement and participation in the constitutional drafting process to be implemented in the coming months. LTI will support a cleanup campaign on three busy beaches and a community park in downtown Benghazi. During these activities, 300 volunteers will disseminate 2-sided flyer titled “What is Constitution” to Libyan families and youths. 

LTI will procure a t-shirt printing equipment consisting of heat press, printer and plotter as well as print 20,000 2-sided flyers titled “What is Constitution” produced by LTI’s Constitution Advisor used in past grants implementation to be distributed by Ayadina’s 300 volunteers during their cleanup campaigns. The fabric printing equipment will be used by Ayadina to support other advocacy campaigns. LTI will also support a media campaign supporting the environment and the constitutional drafting process. For the community park, LTI will procure eight park benches and nine playground recreation equipment.   

This activity assumes that creating active social space for women and other community members to interact will help create positive momentum in Benghazi that fosters peaceful linkages among the community, builds trust between the communities, and reduces the opportunity for extremists to gain support.

This grant aims to empower civil society in Tazirbu to acquire information, engage in dialogue, and participate in Libya's transition through the provision of computer center with internet access and a training site.  This activity will establish a training and computer center with twelve desktop PCs and a one year’s VSAT internet subscription connection. This will be a public meeting space located in the office of the Tazirbu Civil Society Organizations Network (TCSON) in southeast Libya, a region bounded by loose and un-demarcated territories between Egypt and Chad.  TCSON will manage the center and provide computer skills training and election monitoring training to help community members and civil society connect with people, raise issues, and participate in the political process.

",Creating the Space for Debate: Supporting Information Center in Tazirbu,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

Tazirbu is located in south Libya just north of Kufra and west of the Egyptian border. The disruption of informal patronage networks and the fragmentation of formal security services around Tazirbu are accelerating the flow of weapons, goods, and human trafficking along the Southern Eastern borders of Libya. Tazirbu is majority populated by the Zway tribe; they are connected by tribal lineages and clans with Zway tribe in Kufra and all the way north to Ajdabya. When the conflict erupted in Kufra between the Zway and Tebou, Zway in Tazirbu fought alongside the Zway in Kufra.  

This grant is part of a cluster of information technology centers that the Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) is supporting in order to empower civil society to access information, engage in debate, and participate in the political transition process.  Providing this service to Tazirbu Civil Society Organizations Network (TCSON) will create a space that will assist key local partners to develop skills and tools necessary to mobilize advocacy networks, meaningfully engagement in political processes, and monitor the transition’s progress with a particular focus on traditionally marginalized constituencies. Moreover, because of strict cultural restrictions on women in Tazirbu, TCSON will create space for women inside the center to participate in public activities and encourage women active public participation.

The assumption behind this activity is that increased access to information and skills will contribute to Libyans playing a more active role in the transitional processes. Access to information and skills will be reinforced through the local trainer’s coaching participants on internet use, social media and networking. By empowering youth and women to learn about the constitution, women’s rights, reconciliation, transitional justice and other related transition issues, the internet center will facilitate discussions and dialogue around the constitution drafting period. The center will function as a medium for people to gather and learn about political issues which will be accessible to all of Tazirbu’s populations. 

In February 2012, the LTI Field Program Assistant conducted situation assessment in Tazirbu, the assessment stated that there is an active appointed local council and five active local NGOs, who participated in trainings for election monitoring and have since observed the last national election in July 2012. However, these NGOs lack office space and don’t have access to the internet. 

LTI initiated some contact with some member activists of these NGOs; who did express their eagerness to learn more about the role of civil society and civic education.  Five local organizations unified and established a union under the name Tazirbu Civil Society Organizations Network (TCSON). They registered in March 2013 with the local authority of the Ministry of Culture & Civil Society and succeeded in securing office space from the local council. They also collected donations and renovated the office space.  

On June 2013, LTI formally received a request from a TCSON representative requesting LTI support in providing computers and internet services to support civil society to meet and engage in political life. TCSON also identified the need for skilled and trained local election observers to cover the upcoming local municipality elections. The municipality elections are taking place across Libya and the need for trained observers is necessary to support transparent election. 

In addition, LTI plans to promote sustainability of the center by hiring an STTA who will work with the grantee to develop a business model to maintain internet connection costs. Since LTI hopes to replicate this type of civil society-internet center arrangement in multiple areas, this technical expertise will be hired through a separate STTA agreement rather than a budget line with this individual grant. Additionally, LTI is looking to bring in other STTAs to provide additional advocacy skills and online media training to help civil society more effectively use the computer center as an advocacy platform.

This grant seeks to promote reconciliation and national unity by supporting a tolerance campaign in Benghazi. The activity will partner with Boza store to print 500 t-shirts with creative messages on tolerance and support a poster and billboard campaign featuring prominent public figures wearing these t-shirts. Benghazi is the central hub of varying political and social voices and is the birthplace of many credible and emerging political activists. Boza is a popular, innovative store that uses clever designs on clothing, and the owner Ahmed Ben-Mussa is a political activist who can mobilize other activists in spreading important messages.

",Campaigning for Tolerance in Style! Supporting Boza Clothing Store in Benghazi,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity and inclusive processes based on tolerance between citizens.

One of LTI’s main strategic objectives is to mitigate destabilizing conflict and one of the primary causes of conflict whether it is armed, economic or political is the general intolerance of different parties towards each other and the central Hub for the various political and social viewpoints is Benghazi. There have been a number of events in recent months that have contributed to a negative mood in Benghazi- the way the political isolation law was passed, the Jalaa hospital bombing, the Libyan Shield 1 attack and a resumption of targeted assassinations after a brief lull earlier in the year. This activity seeks to support civil society activists and prominent public figures to counter this trend to launch a tolerance campaign.

In Benghazi, like most areas around Libya, citizens are very much affected by visual images accompanied by written messages and one example which has implemented a successful project based on visual imagery is Boza store in Benghazi. This store opened in early 2013 and it’s the first of its kind in Libya. Boza sells T-shirts and scarfs of original designs based on Libyan eye-catching images accompanied by colloquial Libyan phrases. The owner Ahmed Ben-Mussa is a political activist himself who blogs regularly about on-going events in Libya and has many followers on-line in Libya especially in Benghazi.

This activity also aims to support Boza store (Boza stands for stylish) in the design and printing of t-shirts with Libyan phrases related to tolerance printed on them accompanied by related images and drawings. The campaign will be followed by the distribution of these t-shirts to CSO activists and youth sports teams and clubs. The support will also include photographing known political activists and media personalities who will wear the T-shirts and subsequent printing of posters and placement of the photographs on billboards around Benghazi.
 
This activity assumes that promoting tolerance through the engagement of a local Benghazi business and known personalities will support a credible and stable transition by contributing to the mitigation of conflict that results from intolerance.

Promoting peaceful public participation in Libya’s transition to constitutional democracy, this activity will support outreach activities to raise awareness and disseminate information about women’s rights in Al Wahat region, where tribal customs still define gender roles. The Four one-day seminars will be held in the major towns of the region; Ajdabiya, Jalu, Awjilah and Jakharrad focusing on women’s rights, the constitutional drafting process and exposing participants to advocacy planning. At the end of each seminar, participants will spend some time to develop and submit an advocacy plan supporting a women’s cause. The grantee will also distribute 10,000 booklets  – half in the Wahat region and the other in rural towns around Benghazi – covering women’s rights in education, employment, family law and political participation.  The booklet content will be presented in a simple, easy to read manner with descriptive sketches. “Why Me” Women’s Rights society is an organization made up of a small group of mid-class women determined through their community activities, to guide women on how to advocate for their rights and to network together to support each other.

",Reaching Out to Women in Rural Communities to Talk Constitution,"
In September 2011, Libya’s Transitional National Council released a Constitutional Charter for the Transitional Stage of the country’s democratic development, and in July 2012 Libya successfully held its first democratic elections in more than four decades. 200 members of the General National Congress (GNC) were elected and charged with appointing the committee that will draft Libya’s new constitution.  After a period of stagnation that involved a long debate on whether the drafting committee should be appointed or elected, a final decision was made in early February to popularly elect the committee.  Therefore, on April 11, 2013 the GNC formed a committee to write the law for electing the Constitution Drafting Assembly. 

Al-Wahah region (180,000 pop) is located in eastern Libya south of Ajdabiya and its main towns include Jalu, Awjilah and Jakharrad. Although the region sits atop of Libya’s most significant oil producing wells, the region has been severely marginalized by past and present governments. Recently, demonstrations by locals have taken place to voice anger against this continued marginalization and threats have been issued to cutoff the supply of crude oil going to Libya’s ports. 

With the exception of Ajdabiya, the Wahat consists of mostly dispersed populations within the main towns of Jalu, Awjilah and Jakharrad. Tribal customs in al-Wahat region define gender roles, restricting women’s opportunities to seek higher education and employment opportunities. The environment is also having a detrimental impact on women's health with many women dealing fertility problems. Moreover, women within these rural communities have not had many opportunities to participate in women awareness campaigns or learn about women’s rights.

‘Why Me’ Women Rights Society’s activity will implement four one-day seminars in Ajdabiya, Jalu, Awjilah and Jakharrad focusing on women’s rights, the constitutional drafting process and exposing participants to advocacy planning. This activity will support women in understanding their legal rights under the present Libyan law and the importance of participation in the upcoming constitutional drafting process to ensure that women’s rights gained are protected and to advocate for more rights consistent with international laws. At the end of each seminar, participants will spend some time to develop and submit an advocacy plan supporting a women’s cause. 

This activity also includes the distribution of 10,000 copies – half in the Wahat region and the other in rural towns around Benghazi – covering women’s rights in education, employment, family law and political participation. During the seminars constitution dialogue facilitation reference guides developed by LTI will be distributed to the participants.  

Society “Why Me” Women Rights was established June 2011 to contribute to the promotion of women’s rights establishing a culture of equality for Libyan women by raising their awareness of such principles as liberty and security as well as advocating for the elimination of all political and cultural obstacles that prevent women from pursuing their personal and professional aspirations.

By supporting this activity, USAID/OTI will support women in marginalized areas and assist them in having their voices heard.

This activity will create a rapid crisis response mechanism to strengthen local conflict mitigation initiatives in the east by empowering civil society groups to promote reconciliation and peaceful participation in the political transition. In reaction to increased insecurity and urgent requests for support from a variety of local partners, this DDGS will provide material and logistical assistance for public dialogues, outreach campaigns, and other conflict mitigation activities that emerge from evolving trends. The current wave of targeted assassinations, anti-militia backlash, and political volatility in the east erodes public confidence in the transition, emboldens extremists, and complicates implementation of key transition milestones. Complementing ongoing government stabilization initiatives, this DDGS will provide a flexible tool to help civil society groups be catalysts for change on the ground.

",On Alert! Crisis Response Fund in eastern Libya,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust towards government.  

Declining security in eastern Libya has become an increasing threat to the nation’s transition process. In Benghazi, a clash on June 8 between protestors and the Libyan Shield One forces – a militia loosely aligned with the Ministry of Defense and commanded by Wissam Bin Hamid -- left 31 dead and approximately 100 injured. Mounting anger against irregular militias has been accompanied by an increase in targeted assassinations. Most recently, on July 26 a prominent activist who founded the 17 February Coalition, Abdulsalem Musmari, was assassinated in broad daylight by a suspected sniper as he left a mosque after Friday prayers, triggering a large wave of protests in the streets of Benghazi. A massive explosion rocked Benghazi’s main courthouse on July 28, the latest and most severe incident in a series of bombings against police stations and vehicles.  Similarly, there has been an escalation of assassinations in Derna and an expansion of violence and extremist presence into Sirte. 

The Libyan government has taken positive steps in recent months, including passing a law to elect the committee that will draft a new constitution and announcing a new plan to fully integrate militia members into a new national force. However, these initiatives will take time, and continued violence erodes public confidence in the credibility of the government and the legitimacy of the transition. It also complicates the ability to implement upcoming transition milestones, such as municipal elections and elections for the Constituent Assembly that will draft the constitution. The violence also risks having a chilling effect on civil society engagement in the political process, as groups lose hope and become increasingly concerned for their own safety. 

This DDGS will create a flexible fund to rapidly respond to urgent requests for support from civil society organization that are trying to do positive, practical things to push back against the declining security trends. LTI has received a number of requests from organizations for quick interventions such as holding dialogues to promote reconciliation, conducting peace messaging outreach campaigns, and facilitating opportunities for community members to engage with government officials on the current challenges. This DDGS will create a responsive mechanism and clear process so that OTI can swiftly approve an array of anticipated civil society-led activities to bolster stability in the east during a critical period in the Libya’s transition.

This activity assumes that there will be sufficient security in the east over the next six months to provide stable space for civil society to conduct activities on the ground.

Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule and only recently did the GNC pass the election law the constitutional drafting committee. Many in the know believe that the constitutional drafting committee will not start its work until the early 2014. The new state has also struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

The problem is particularly acute in Derna, a conservative religious city with a legacy of extremism and distrust towards government (est. population of 180,000). During the Qadhafi regime, Derna was the base of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) and the port through which most Libyan jihadis passed on their way to Afghanistan and Iraq. After the war in Afghanistan ended, returning LIFG fighters set their sights on toppling the Qadhafi government and launched a failed rebellion. Qadhafi responded with a brutal crackdown that collectively punished the citizens of Derna, destroying development and exacerbating grievances that continue to be exploited by extremists.  

This grant is part of a cluster of information technology centers that the Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) is supporting in order to empower civil society to access information, engage in debate, and participate in the political transition process.  Providing this service to WUCD will create a space that will assist key local partners to develop skills and tools necessary to mobilize advocacy networks, meaningfully engage in political processes, and monitor the transition’s progress. Since this service will be provided by WUCD, the target beneficiaries will be women from Derna and surrounding communities. The WUCD center will create space for women and encourage their participation in public life.

",Taking a Step Back and Assessing Capacity: WAC Workshop,"
On October 29, 2011 the National Transitional Council (NTC) declared the establishment of the Warriors’ Affairs Commission (WAC) with the aim of registering in 30 offices around Libya all armed and non-armed fighters who fought in the revolution, and to build a comprehensive database with their contact information, technical skills and educational background. The overall goal of WAC is to disarm and reintegrate these individuals either through skills/job training, further education or integration into the National Police and Army.  

The Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) views WAC as a strategic government partner.  The LTI program has already worked with WAC (under BENG014) and supported the training of 240 former thuwar leaders (18+ years) through eight three-day workshops in Benghazi, Tripoli, Misrata, Gharyan and Al Bayda,  pulling in leaders from across the country and is focusing on conflict resolution and non-violent communication skills. It is expected that these leaders will be seen and act as change agents that promote stability in their local communities. 

While WAC is very active in its training efforts, it has not been able to effectively strategize the next steps for their assistance and has not done well in engaging with the donor community nor inter-ministerial coordination with line ministries responsible for the funding of WAC program priorities. These include but are not restricted to the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Labor and Ministry of Education. As in every organization, WAC as a government entity has its strengths and weaknesses. International actors including USAID, UN, EU, etc. are in principle willing to provide support to WAC, especially in terms of technical assistance. 

In mid-March 2013, the trainer under BENG014, LTI staff and the head of WAC, Mustafa Elsagezli, the General Manager at WAC, met and discussed different types of support that LTI could provide to WAC. During this meeting and subsequent follow-ups, WAC acknowledged that formulating clear requests for support from international actors based on identified needs is currently weak. A concept was eventually proposed to organize a four day retreat for WAC and that LTI would provide facilitation support to undertake a participatory capacity assessment process with WAC senior management in order to identify their needs for international support. The aim is to come out with a matrix identifying both specific program areas and areas of institutional capacities that could benefit from international support. 

This grant will support the costs of two consultants who will facilitate a four-day workshop that focuses on a participatory capacity assessment process with WAC senior management in Tunis, Tunisia. Subsequently, a meeting will be held in Tripoli with international donors to present the matrix of needs and can be utilized as a basis for discussions on coordinated support from the international community. Additionally, the consultant will follow-up on WAC for an inter-governmental presentation from the Tunis workshop in addition to the meeting with international donors. 

This workshop is the first step in a three-step process. This first step is at a program implementation capacity level. The outcome of this workshop will be a matrix with the strengths and weaknesses of WAC and where they need external support. The matrix could specify external support requirements in terms of international organizations vs. Libyan actors including government and private sector, civil society and media. The second step is institutional analysis (in Benghazi) which will identify reform needs at an institutional, individual, and also environmental level thus how to be better embedded within the government structure. The third step will combine step one and two and lead to a full-fledged capacity development strategy and plan.   

This grant will be managed by Transition International which is a Netherlands-based, international consultancy firm that was established in January 2004. Irma Specht, the main consultant under this grant, has proven expertise in DDR processes, especially in Africa. She has been involved in DDR processes of DRC, Ivory Coast and Liberia. She has been back-stopping the reintegration program for vulnerable combatants in DRC Congo, has assisted to design the reintegration program for Congo Brazzaville and Sri Lanka and Afghanistan and has been earlier involved in the DDR of Zimbabwe and Mali North. Additionally, she is involved in the design and delivery of several training modules and courses on DDR and youth and SALW and is a well-known resource person in international conferences and networks. TI provides knowledge, training and advisory services to the key actors in transition processes in order to make the different stages of transition more transparent, inclusive and sustainable. TI has put a substantial amount of effort into collaboration and trust building with WAC and has been specifically requested for this workshop. 

Additionally, as this workshop will be out of Libya, utilizing an international organization makes sense from an efficiency and practical perspective for the LTI program and supports the usage of a fixed obligation grant as there are clear deliverables indicated in the detailed implementation plan.

This activity assumes that WAC will increase their ability to appropriately program for reintegration efforts and do so in a more strategic and coordinated manner with both the international donor community and government of Libya.

",Growing it Locally: Training on Local Elections Law & Voter Education,"
The creation of responsive, representative local government institutions is a critical component of Libya’s transition. Municipal government is the primary link between people and the state, and these institutions were crippled and corrupted by central control during Qadhafi’s regime. The Transitional National Council passed Law No 59/ 2012 on Local Administration System in June 2012, but the law has been slow to be implemented. During the early phase of the transitional period many local elections took place, including in Benghazi and Derna. The local elections in Benghazi were welcomed with wide support from the citizens of the city with over 70% voter turnout. Since then, there has been frustration and disappointment at the limited progress of the local council in delivering services to the citizens. 

In April, the Ministry of Local Government adopted bylaws for the local government law, which outline in greater detail the roles and responsibilities of the municipal councils and well as laying a foundation for elections and implementation of the law. Over the summer, the Prime Minister’s office created a Municipal Council Election Committee to oversee the vote. On November 30, the first municipal elections under the new laws were held in Al Bayda, Shahat, Bint Baya, and Tazirbu, and succeding rounds of elections will be held in different locations weekly. 

As municipal elections move forward, it is vital that citizens understand the local government law and know their rights as voters so they can make informed decisions. Moreover, it is also imperative that citizens realize the importance of having a legitimate body representing them at a time when illegitimate opportunists groups are trying to take over the government role. These groups include extremist groups who are trying to win over citizens by carrying out community projects, providing security, and even taking over natural resources such as the recent oil feud carried out by an armed group who has laid claim to oil plants in the east and is demanding autonomy for the eastern part of Libya. 

One of the LTI’s main strategic objectives is to promote civic activism. Under this objective the Coordinating Authority for Monitoring the Elections (CAME) will organize a set of trainings for 120 youth in seven areas in eastern Libya including: Benghazi, Al Jaghbub, Shahat, Derna, Tobruk, Al Bayda and Goba on the Local Administration Law, it's bylaws, and how to assess candidates before voting. 20 trainees per area will be selected to take the training. This training will be remain relevant even in areas where municipal elections have already been held since: (1) it will people understand the roles and responsibilities of the new local government institutions and actors, and (2) the public in these communities will also soon be voting again for the Constitution Drafting Assembly, so the training on candidate evaluation will be equally applicable for that process. 

In addition, the youth participants will then conduct outreach campaigns using the information they receive in the training. Campaigns will be launched in each of the seven areas above plue Susah. These campaigns will be carried out in central locations such as universities, schools and central squares. This support will include outreach material and logistical support.

CAME was formed in April 2012 and its main goal is to train interested Libyans on the monitoring of local and national elections. CAME trained over 1000 election monitors in 2012 to monitor GNC national elections and the local council elections in Benghazi. In addition, they then expanded their training programs and conducted trainings on the constitution and human development utilizing their experienced members of academic and legal background as trainers.

This activity assumes that educating citizens on the local government law, the  municipal elections process, and what to look for in candidates when voting will be promote more inclusive and informed public participation in local government.

In order to promote peaceful public participation in Libya’s transition to constitutional democracy, this grant will support outreach activities to disseminate information about the constitution-drafting process and opportunities for public engagement in Derna, a conservative religious city with a deep history of distrust towards central governments. The first activity is two 2-day workshops on the constitution-drafting process. The second activity aims to conduct two one-day public outreach and information dissemination campaigns within Derna and surrounding communities. The workshops will provide participants with leadership skills, necessary tools and opportunities to involve them in the peaceful public engagement by developing and implementing grass-roots outreach campaigns regarding the constitution-drafting process.

",Educating Derna Communities About Constitution-Drafting,"
In September 2011, Libya’s Transitional National Council released a Constitutional Charter for the Transitional Stage of the country’s democratic development and by July 2012 Libya successfully held its first democratic elections in more than four decades. The 200 members of the General National Congress (GNC) that was consequently appointed was charged with appointing a provisional government and a Constitution-Drafting Assembly (CDA) to guide Libya through the constitutional-development process. However, a debate in the GNC arose over whether the CDC should be appointed or elected. The GNC finally agreed with public demands for direct elections and in September 2013 started the process for the Constitution-Drafting Assembly elections.

With so much uncertainty regarding the process by which the constitution will be developed, let alone its content, there is a need for factual, unbiased information presented in a readily accessible manner. This need is particularly great in eastern Libya, where tensions are already rising over key constitutional issues, such as federalism and control of state oil reserves. Moreover, the target region of Derna is a conservative religious city with a deep history of distrust towards government among a disconnected community prone to extremist influence. 

Providing information about the constitution-drafting process and various mechanisms for engagement will both promote stability during this crucial period in Libya’s political transition and provide communities with information needed to avail themselves of engagement mechanisms when these are presented as the constitution-drafting process develops. 

In order to provide this necessary information to eastern Libyan communities, Derna-based coalition of non-governmental organization Derna and Surrounding Communities Network of Civil Society Organizations (DSCNCSO) will train 40 youth and civil society representatives from Derna and surrounding communities on the constitution-drafting process and community engagement as well as support them to conduct one day outreach campaigns within their communities. These campaigns will provide the youth and other participants with opportunities to take leadership roles in their communities, disseminating factual, unbiased information in the form of Information, Education and Communication materials and providing the public with guidance on additional resources regarding the constitution and General National Congress. 

The DSCNCSO was setup in the spring of 2011 and is a union of approximately 60 civil society organizations and around 600 individual members in total. DSCNCSO is an active and prominent organization within Derna initially working on collecting foodstuffs, medicines and other essentials for civilian communities on the front lines during the 2011 revolution. After liberation, DSCNCSO’s major activities focused on raising awareness and dissemination of information through dialogue seminars and distribution of flyers. These activities took place around the elections for the Derna Local Council and the General National Congress. Some of the leading civil society activist have partnered with LTI to implement part of Derna al-Zehra campaign (BENG027). DSCNCSO’s most recent activities have focused on developing dialogue amongst stakeholders within Derna and its surrounding communities. 

This activity assumes that by engaging youth and community activists, increasing their awareness of the constitution-drafting process and providing them with opportunities to engage with their communities, they will advance public understanding of constitutional development processes and thereby promote public participation in Libya’s transition to democracy.

BENG045,Warriors Affairs Commission,Closed,2013-11-14,2014-01-31,49369.43,49369.43,"
This grant aims to promote the reintegration of former revolutionary fighters (thuwar) by increasing their ability to play a positive, practical role in local dispute mediation and conflict mitigation initiatives. Building on a previous grant (BENG014), this activity will provide two six-day training workshops in advanced conflict analysis, facilitated dialogues, and leadership skills to a select group of approximately 68 former high-ranking thuwar who are participating in the Warrior Affairs Commission’s (WAC) reintegration program. The trainings will be held in the Tripoli and will gather thuwar from all regions. Thuwar are influential leaders who can be stabilizers or spoilers in the transition, and WAC is the key government body mandated to support their peaceful and productive reintegration.

",The Next Step: Former Thuwars'  Adv. Training in Conflict Management & Dialogue,"
Promoting the peaceful and productive reintegration of former revolutionary fighters (thuwar) is one of the most critical priorities faced by the Libyan Government. Thousands of thuwar took up arms to overthrow Qadhafi, but following the revolution they were not systematically integrated into formal security services or reintegrated back into civilian live. Thuwar are influential leaders with the potential to play a positive role in supporting the transition. However thuwar are also typically young men who lack educational or vocational opportunities, have easy access to weapons, and suffered physical and psychological trauma during the revolution. Without a comprehensive plan to effectively incorporate them into state and society, these thuwar can be easily mobilized by militias and manipulated by extremist groups. 

To address this urgent issue, LTI partnered with the Warrior Affairs Commission (WAC) to equip a select group of ex-thuwar with practical skills to be on the front line of conflict management and peace building in their communities. Established by the National Transition Council (NTC) on October 29, 2011, the WAC is a national institution that leads Libya’s reintegration efforts. A cornerstone of the WAC’s strategy is to create a pool of trained local leaders who can be active advocates for peaceful dialogue on the ground. Under BENG014, an international expert on conflict transformation provided six three-day introductory workshops in five cities from March to May across the country to over 200 former revolutionaries and brigade leaders. At the request of WAC and based on very positive feedback from the initial round of trainings, a subsequent amendment added two additional workshops in September in order to ensure that thuwar from key cities like Zintan, Sirte, Bani Walid, and Sabha were included. 

A first step forward in WAC’s vision, the workshops trained ex-thuwar on how to analyze the causes of conflict, identify key conflict management actors, use basic conflict resolution skills, and practice non-violent communication techniques. Applying interactive training methods, the trainer provided participants with a better understanding of basic leadership skills and consensus decision making practices. Additionally, these workshops were an opportunity for WAC to identify individuals for future development through a WAC’s leadership program, which seeks to prepare former commanders and influential thuwar to play a constructive role in government and communities.

This activity is the next phase in WAC’s evolving plan. During the introductory workshops, the trainer assessed the participant’s capacity and motivation and created a list of the top performers. This grant will provided two six-day workshops for 68 selected thuwar. The course will build on the initial introductory courses by providing advanced skills in conflict analyses, facilitating dialogue and leadership. The combination of their talent, the basis of selection, and the additional skills and competencies that they will get from this 6-day intensive course is intended to equip the majority of the participants to actually facilitate dialogue between conflicting groups at community, business, or public institution levels. 

This activity also reinforces BENG040, which supported a participatory capacity assessment workshop where WAC senior management developed a matrix identifying their strengths, weaknesses, and external support needs. With support from LTI, WAC is engaging in a comprehensive review process that seeks to enhance the effectiveness of WAC's reintegration efforts by reviewing their strategic goals and technical programs, analyzing their institutional capacity, and formulating a plan for capacity development. As a result of these combined efforts, WAC will have a clearer strategic vision and stronger institutional capacity to utilize the thuwar who receive the advanced skills from this training. 

This activity assumes that providing selected and vetted thuwar leaders with conflict resolution skills will help mitigate conflict and promote stability.

",The Grass is Greener on Other Side - Supporting Moderate Voices in Benghazi,"
The Libyan transitional period has taken a turn for the worse recently following direct conflict between army forces and extremist militias in Benghazi in late November 2013 followed by an increase in the frequency of targeted assassinations against army members. Following these events frustrated citizens have taken to the streets condemning these events and demanding a strong presence of only state institutions.

The citizens of Libya and Benghazi especially have continuously expressed their support for democracy which has been highlighted recently in the NDI survey where over 80% of Libyans still believe that democracy is the best mode of governance for Libya. They have also expressed that extremism is not an option for the future of Libya and that any governmental or non-governmental organization should display a moderate outlook. 

One of LTI's key program objectives is to bolster security by supporting moderate voices in an effort to ensure that Libya's political transition is a credible and stable one. One moderate and credible organization is an environmental organization called Beeati (My Environment) who were formed in August 2011 and have since then implemented projects with ACTED and Creative Associates involving tree-planting and gardening in public spaces especially educational institutions. 

This activity aims to support Beeati in planting trees and reviving the gardens in the higher education academy in As Sabiri area in Benghazi while allowing the students and potentially locals and local activists to take part in the activity. The space will also be utilized for a one-day outreach campaign conducted by HNEC to distribute leaflets and posters provided by HNEC on the elections of the constitution-drafting committee. As Sabiri area is a known area in Benghazi for high incidence of crime and a location where a substantial number of extremists reside and so the local residents will also benefit from this activity.

This activity assumes that by supporting moderate voices in taking the lead role in educating citizens on key democratic processes through community engagement in vulnerable and extremist-prone areas that they will contribute to bolstering security in during the transitional period.

This activity will support a one-day conference in Benghazi that will gather 20 female candidates for the Constitution Drafting Assembly (CDA) from Benghazi, Kufra, Derna, Bayda, Marj, Ajdabiya and Tobruk along with female voters to discuss, develop, and disseminate recommendations on strengthening the role of women in the constitution development process. Low voter registration and widespread apathy jeopardizes the credibility of the upcoming CDA elections, and it is critical that women have an opportunity to effectively engage in the drafting process. Society Why Me Women Rights is a Benghazi-based civil society organization focused on the promotion of women’s rights and establishing a culture of equality for Libyan women.

",Promoting Women's Participation in the CDA,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

After long delays and much uncertainty, the GNC decided on February 06, 2013 to hold popular elections for the committee that will draft Libya’s post-revolution constitution. The law to elect the committee was approved by the GNC on July 16. Under the election law, the 60-member committee will be composed of 20 members from each of the nation’s three regions – East, West, and South. Six seats will be allocated for women, and three minority groups – Tuareg, Tebu, and Amazigh -- will each receive two seats. The High National Elections Committee (HNEC) is responsible for preparing the election, including voter registration, candidate registration, and developing the mechanisms to implement the election law. Elections are expected to be held towards the end of February 2014. In Eastern Libya, twenty female candidates from Benghazi, Kufra, Derna, Bayda, Marj, Ajdabiya and Tobruk are running for the Constitution Drafting Assembly (CDA) elections.

One of the LTI’s main program objectives is to promote inclusive implementation of key political processes. Under this objective the Society Why Me Women's Rights will organize a one-day conference in Benghazi that will allow  20 female candidates from the East to meet with citizens and listen to their expectations with regards to women’s rights that need to be proposed in the drafting of the constitution discussions. The conference participants will be prominent and active female civic actors, including University professors, school teachers, government employees, and medical professionals.Topics for the disucssion will include: (a) challenges facing women to participate in the CDA elections; (b) the importance of female participation and the value added to the drafting of the constitution; (c) ideas for reconciling women's rights with sharia; (d) and recommendations to the CDA for ensuring that women have an effective role in drafting the constitution. These recommendations will be printed on 2000 flyers that will be distributed throughout the East, and the grantee will also attempt to present them to national-level actors. In addition, the grantee will distribute 7000 booklets on the rights of women printed under BENG036. LTI will provide material and logistical support. 

Society Why Me Women's Rights was formed in June 2011 and is contributing to the promotion of women’s rights establishing a culture of equality for Libyan women by raising their awareness of such principles like liberty and security as well as advocating for the elimination of all political and cultural obstacles that prevent women from pursuing their personal and professional aspirations. They are targeting rural women and those with little or no educational backgrounds.  ‘Why Me’ is led by a small group of mid-class women determined through their community activities to guide women on how to advocate for their rights and to network together to support each other. Members of ‘Why Me’ attended training and monitored Libya’s General National Congress elections in July 2012. They also conducted activities targeting political awareness women, specially the right to vote. The organization also visits female prisons to in an attempt to prevent social inequality and violence. Most recently, the organization implemented BENG036 with the support of LTI. BENG036 involved conducting four (4) one-day seminars in AlWahat region and Ajdabya. The seminars focused on raising women rights awareness, highlighting rights gained and rights at risk, challenges facing women in sustaining their political rights as well as building solidarity amongst women. 

This activity assumes that exposing citizens to the role of women in the drafting the constitution campaign and encouraging dialogue between citizens and candidates will promote more inclusive and informed public participation in the constitution- drafting committee elections.

",Youth Leadership: Grooming Libya’s Future Generations in Benghazi,"
During the Libyan 2011 revolution, many young Libyans risked and sacrificed their lives in order for Libya to free itself from 40 years of tyranny. They participated as fighters on the front lines, supported the frontlines logistically, contributed to the revolution media machine as well as assisted displaced refugees. Since liberation, time and time again youths have continued to strive for a better and positive future. February 2014 saw the Libyan national football team composed of mostly fresh young inexperience talents bring home the 2014 African Football Cup, the first major trophy in Libyan sports history. Most Libyan youths have a can-do and do-it-yourself spirit; they never saw the brutality of the Qadhafi regime during the seventies and eighties. They only started becoming adults during the mid to late nineties when the Libyan government started to open up opportunities to the private sector. It was a time when satellite TV and the internet allowed Libyans to connect with the rest of the world. 

This activity is part of LTI’s support for “Think Nationally, Act Locally” strategy, enabling partners to implement practical activities that promote positive civic activism, address immediate issues of local and national concern, and boost stability. It intends to support civic activism by supporting Ayadina Youth Group, a youth-led civil society group, to launch a campaign to raise health, nutrition, and exercise awareness at elementary schools. Given the very sensitive and insecure environment in Benghazi, this type of activity can contribute to stability by creating opportunities for moderate voices to engage youth, serve as role models for practical local civic activism, and spread an important message in conflict and extremism prone neighborhoods that youth are the foundation of stable future in Libya. 

The target schools will include both private and public school with some focus on neighborhoods where youths can be likely targets for extremist recruitment, such as Sabri District and Birkah, Sidi Hussein, and Fuwayhat neighborhoods. As part of the activity, children will participate in mini-marathons at the local city zoo. This component seeks to capitalize on the momentum of the Mararthon for Hope (BENG037), which generated a lot of attention and local enthusiasm. Ayadina Youth Group will also be running a public media campaign on local youth radio station promoting its awareness activities as well as submitting petitions and recommendations to local educational authorities on implementing standards for food services at local schools.

The Ayadina Youth Group is the youth branch of Ayadina for Social Solidarity, a civil society organization led by women (formed in July 2006, officially registered in September 2008) that was established by Nori Ahmed Sherif a retired headmaster of a girls’ high school to support and assistance the less fortunate residents of Benghazi. Membership of Ayadina today stands at approximately 125 members and most of whom can always be seen participating in the organization’s activities. Ayadina Youth Group’s visions for Libya, includes a civil and multiparty state, run by institutions with such rights as equality for all, freedom of speech and thought. Ayadina Youth Group strives for Libya to have high standards of education, health and public services.

This activity assumes that creating opportunities for moderate civil society voices to productively engage youth will help promote positive civic activism and reduce the space for extremist spoilers to influence Benghazi's youth and schools.

This activity will support LOPC with materials for an anti-weapon campaign including Billboards, flyers, sticky posters and a PSA in Derna, Benghazi, Sebha, Kufra, Pirsis and Marj. These areas are all hubs for extremists and have been locations where a high number of assassinations and inter-tribal conflict have taken place as a result of the wide spread of weapons. LOPC has conducted many activities since in formation in August 2011 including a clean-up campaign in February 2013 in Benghazi and they teamed up with the Special Forces in early 2012 to support them in the collection of arms from citizens which was very successful and they were awarded a certificate for their achievements by the Special Forces.

",Keep the Arms Away: Anti-weapons Campaign in Eastern & Southern Libya,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

In order to counter the destabilizing trend of public disengagement, LTI is providing catalytic support to enable civil society to effectively participate creating opportunities to impact their communities and bolster security.  

The wide spread use of weapons has been especially concentrated in the eastern cities of Benghazi, Derna and other areas in the south such as Kufra and Sebha which has led to multiple assassinations and other crimes including car-jacking and attacks by armed groups on state institutions such as hospitals and schools and inter-tribal conflict.  It is vital that moderate voices support community initiatives to contribute to the prevention of illegal arms use and the attempts made by illegal armed groups to take on youth to join them. 

One such civil society organization which is also a moderate voice is the International Libyan Organization for Culture and Peace which was founded in August 2011 with 70 registered members from Benghazi, Derna, Bayda and Sebha. Since then it has implemented many campaigns including a clean-up campaign in February 2013 in Benghazi and they teamed up with the Special Forces in early 2012 to support them in the collection of arms from citizens which was very successful and they were awarded a certificate for their achievements by the Special Forces.

The main beneficiaries of this activity will be male youth as they are vulnerable to being pulled into illegal and extremist militias as trends have shown especially in Benghazi and Derna and it's imperative they are aware of the dangers of illegal weapons use.

This campaign will include 50 Billboards, 50000 flyers, 20000 sticky posters and a PSA which will be screened in Benghazi. The activity is planned to start on the 19th of March which coincides with the remembrance of the victims that lost their lives after the attack of the Gadhafi forces in 2011 after entering Benghazi and in which there will probably be many citizens on the streets organizing several memorial ceremonies and so it is an opportunity for the campaign to have maximum exposure. The distribution will be conducted by the 70 members of the organization.

This activity assumes that by enhancing the capacity of moderate voices to promote stability in a way visible to citizens it will promote citizen awareness to illegal armed groups and extremists which are endangering the future of youth and obstructing national security while impeding the progress of the transition in Libya.

",Raising Visibility: Key Media and Publicity Support in Eastern Libya,"
Three years after the revolt that overthrew four decades of tyranny, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads, with slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance is creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. Extremists are utilizing the status quo to recruit youths into their fanatical motived ideological organizations and for illegitimate activities. As well the Libyan government has not been successful in handling the security situation, nor opened dialogue to deal with major unaddressed economic concerns and political grievances. 

In Benghazi, the birthplace of Libya’s revolution and symbol of the transition’s challenges, incidents of political/ideological violence occur on a daily basis and groups like Ansar al-Sharia continue to target Special Forces and create instability and public disengagement. Moreover, with most media outlets located in the Libyan capital Tripoli, local residents in the eastern Libya are unable to voice their demands for security and priorities for the economic and administrative development of their communities through a just distribution of Libya’s wealth. 

The national government has however taken some positive steps forward in pushing for municipal local elections, launching a National Dialogue campaign and the elections of the Constitutional Drafting Assembly. Accordingly, it is critical to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

As part of the 2014 ramp up strategy, LTI will provide administrative support to the Arab Screen Independent Film Festival (ASIFF) in the form of working space, support staff as well as equipment and materials to support civic activism during Libya transition to an open democracy. LTI is actively seeking to engage moderate voices and politically marginalized groups in Benghazi, and build their linkages across Libya to promote an inclusive and informed participation in key political processes.

ASIFF has proven record in engaging senior government officials in its activities, effectively connecting with the common man of the street through their appealing campaigns and utilizing its networked of young media professionals and enthusiasts to amplify the impact of its activities. ASIFF will be an ideal and strong focal point in supporting and implementing LTI media and publicity activities in Benghazi and East Libya. Previously ASIFF implemented the Marathon of Hope campaign in response to intensified tension within Benghazi city limits. The Marathon of Hope triggered an extraordinary response from local residents bring out more than 750 local participants, many women to participated and support the initiative.

",Tangible Change: Supporting Community Improvement in Derna,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

Derna is a conservative religious city with a legacy of distrust towards government and extremism (est. population of 180,000). During the Qadhafi regime, Derna was the base of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) and the port through which most Libyan jihadis passed on their way to Afghanistan and Iraq. After the war in Afghanistan ended, returning LIFG fighters set their sights on toppling the Qadhafi government and launched a failed rebellion. Qadhafi responded with a brutal crackdown that collectively punished the citizens of Derna, destroying development and exacerbating grievances that continue to be exploited by extremists such as Ansar al Sharia and Abu Salim Martyrs Brigade. Despite attempts by moderate voices to protest against expanding extremist influence, Derna had the highest per capita assassination rate in Libya in 2013 and government presence remains minimal. 

In response to these trends, LTI is implementing clusters of visible, tangible community improvement projects that help to boost government legitimacy, bolster community security, and spark local-level change. By bringing together local authorities, civil society, and the private sector to deliver practical projects like community parks and football fields, these activities aim to build relationships among key stakeholders and improve confidence in the transition. The projects seek to empower moderate voices to ‘Think Nationally, Act Locally,” strengthen local resiliencies that reject extremism, and promote conflict-sensitive local development. To maximize impact, LTI will work with local partners to ensure that there is a media plan in place to publicize and promote the projects. 

Over the last year, LTI has layered a foundation of activities -- a football field, community park, and information center -- as well as a network of relationships with moderate voices in Derna. With security declining, public confidence deteriorating, and the destabilizing presence of extremists, Derna is a significant priority for LTI's community improvement ramp up. On March 19, LTI representatives met in Bayda with stakeholders from Derna, including the local Ministry of Culture representative. The Derna stakeholders highlighted the need and opportunity to implement community improvement projects, and offered a number of specific examples of possible activities, including: installing street lights and park equipment along the cities central corniche area; procuring and delivering trash bins; and small-scale beautification projects and clean-up campaigns. 

As a result, this DDGS will create a rapid response fund to support community improvement projects in Derna. A range of progressive civic activists -- the Scouts and the Derna Women's Union, for example -- will work on these projects in coordination with the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, and other government actors that emerge as positive partners. The activities will primarily focus on the Corniche, due to it high visibility, and the Bab Shiha and Shahel neighborhoods, which are more densely populated with high concentrations of youth and concerns about extremist recruitment.

This activity seeks to support civic activism and boost confidence in the transition in Shahat and Bayda by enabling key stakeholders to implement practical, visible community improvement projects. This DDGS will create a rapid response fund to provide material and logistical support for small-scale rehabilitation and revitalization projects. The neighboring cities of Bayda and Shahat both conducted municipal council elections at the end of November 2013, but the councils have not received budgets and public frustration is mounting as local development remains stalled. This DDGS will provide a flexible tool to help government actors and civil society groups be catalysts for tangible change within their communities.

",Tangible Change: Supporting Community Improvement in Shahat and Bayda,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

Located in eastern Libya’s Jebel Akdhar region, Bayda has a population of approximately 250,000 and is strategically important for several reasons. It is the fourth largest city in Libya and the second largest city in the East. Once the political capital of the Kingdom of Libya, it was home to the U.S. Embassy 
from 1963 to 1969, and still houses critical public infrastructure, including the nation’s second 
largest bank, the National Commercial Bank. Libya’s second largest military airport, Labraq
airport is located twenty miles east of the city. Bayda conducted municipal elections at the end of November 2013 and will likely host the Constitution Drafting Assembly. 

Shahat is 24k east of Bayda and has a population of approximately 43,000. Shahat is a strategic focus area for the Libya Transition Initiative due to its partners, proximity, stability, and visibility. First, LTI has already partnered with the strong Shahat Civil Society Network on an information center project. There is a very active women’s group headed by the newly elected Local Council Deputy Chairman, and there is a radio station that provides a platform for transition-related programming and reaches Derna. Second, the space between Shahat and Derna – Ras al-Hillal, Qubah, and the Jebel Akdar region generally – is believed to be the primary safe haven for extremists groups in the region. Combined with continued engagement in Derna, the Shahat cluster will frame this area and provide a strategic entry point into these surrounding areas. Third, Shahat is relatively secure platform that enables LTI to implement community improvement projects immediately that can generate models and momentum. Finally, although it is relatively small, the Shahat region is popular destination with a high profile and large potential for tourism due to the presence of Greek ruins. Shahat’s rich heritage is also a very visible and potent counter-narrative to extremist groups who are attempting to rewrite Libya’s cultural history and identity.

LTI is implementing clusters of visible, tangible community improvement projects that help to boost government legitimacy, bolster community security, and spark local-level change. By bringing together local authorities, civil society, and the private sector to deliver practical projects like community parks and football fields, these activities aim to build relationships among key stakeholders and improve confidence in the transition. The projects seek to empower moderate voices to ‘Think Nationally, Act Locally,” strengthen local resiliencies that reject extremism, and promote conflict-sensitive local development. To maximize impact, LTI will work with local partners to ensure that there is a media plan in place to publicize and promote the projects.

LTI's community improvement cluster in Shahat and Bayda will reinforce a region that has thus far remained resilient to expanding extremism and escalating violence in the east, while also helping pilot models for how newly elected municipal councils can work with civil society to promote stability through local development. After meeting with a range of local stakeholders, LTI has already received a number of requests for potential projects, including street lights and signs, garbage bins, and playground equipment. These activities require the ability to quickly procure and deliver community improvement goods or services in situations where a local partner is not immediately available. 

This activity assumes that there will be sufficient stability in Shahat and Bayda to access and implement a cluster of community improvement projects.

This grant seeks to enhance the capacity of moderate voices to engage at-risk groups in community projects. This activity will support a local non-governmental organization in Benghazi, Ayadina for Social Solidarity, with administrative material and communication equipment.  This support will enable Ayadina with the assistance of LTI to implement four community improvement projects including the renovation of two community parks, a football field and a library and theatre in future grants and will also allow Ayadina to carry out community mobilization ahead of the community projects. The areas of these projects, Al-Birkah, Sidi Husayn, and As- Sabiri in Benghazi, are all central hubs for extremists especially Al-Berka and As- Sabiri and also high incidence of crime.  A moderate, active local civil society organization with large youth membership, Ayadina is able to reach a wide network of youth and women in all these areas and already has demonstrated experience in engaging with these residents of these areas and in implementing tangible, successful community improvement projects.

",Empowering the Moderate: Community Mobilization Support for Ayadina,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

The birthplace of Libya’s revolution, Benghazi has become a symbol of the transition’s challenges. During the first quarter of 2014, nearly half of all recorded incidents of violence occurred in Benghazi. Targeted assassinations, calls for federalism, and expanding extremist influence are all symptomatic of underlying, unaddressed economic and political grievances. The government has stepped up security deployments, but extremist groups like Ansar al-Sharia continue to clash with Special Forces and create instability. 

In response to these trends, LTI is implementing clusters of visible, tangible community improvement projects that help to boost government legitimacy, bolster community security, and spark local-level change. By bringing together local authorities, civil society, and the private sector to deliver practical projects like community parks and football fields, these activities aim to build relationships among key stakeholders and improve confidence in the transition. The projects seek to empower moderate voices to ‘Think Nationally, Act Locally,” strengthen local resiliencies that reject extremism, and promote conflict-sensitive local development. To maximize impact, LTI will work with local partners to ensure that there is a media plan in place to publicize and promote the projects. 

Ayadina is a moderate, female-led civil society organization from Benghazi. They have strong relationships with key actors on the ground, they are from the area and therefore understand the local dynamics, and they have successfully implemented similar community improvement activities with LTI in the past (e.g. BENG032).

The main beneficiaries of this activity will be youth as they are particularly vulnerable to being attracted to or recruited into illegal and extremist militias, as the trend has shown especially in Benghazi and they need positive engagement opportunities.  Other beneficiaries will include women and children who will benefit from community projects in Benghazi as it will allow them to feel more active as citizens and increase their morale which has been low as a result of the deteriorating security situation. 

LTI will provide administrative support to Ayadina in the form of working space, communication equipment and administrative material in the main building location of Ayadina in Sidi Husayn. With LTI support under future grants, Ayadina will assist LTI in the implementation of community improvement projects, which will include the rehabilitation of a) two community parks and b) a football field and c) the renovation of a library and theatre in Ayadina’s main location. These projects will cover the Al-Birkah, As Sabiri and Sidi Husayn areas in the city of Benghazi. In addition the support under this grant will enable Ayadina to carry out workshops and other activities utilizing the working space and additional support will be provided to Ayadina to carry out community mobilization for the upcoming community projects.

This activity assumes that by providing administrative support to Ayadina this will ultimately enhance the capacity of moderate voices to productively engage at-risk groups through positive community projects.

This activity will support the creation of a social hub to provide youth with an effective alternative to engaging in extremists’ activities in Derna, which has become the largest recruitment and training area for extremists groups operating throughout Africa and the Middle East. In particular, OTI will provide the al-Najoum Sporting Club with sports equipment and uniforms, and help them find ways to promote their club. Derna, once considered as the cultural and artistic melting pot of Libyan society, was marginalized under the Qaddafi regime, which created an environment for extremism to take root and flourish.  Established in 1984, the Al-Najoum sporting club has been working to increase sporting spaces in Derna to counteract extremist recruitment in poorer neighborhoods.

",Spring Cleaning: Official Launch of the al-Najoum Football Club in Derna,"
Three years since the start of the Libyan revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Dissatisfaction with the performance of both GNC and government has created widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support and participation within the transitional process exacerbating grievances that extremists and spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. 

The Libyan government has taken positive steps forward, creating a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process and more important recently carrying out the elections for the Constitution Drafting Assembly. Hence, there is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

Derna, once considered as the cultural and artistic melting pot of Libyan society, is a very conservative and religious city. It has an estimated population of 180,000 and a legacy of distrust towards government. During the Qadhafi regime, Derna was the base of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) and the port through which most Libyan jihadis passed on their way to Afghanistan and Iraq. After the war in Afghanistan ended, returning LIFG fighters set their sights on toppling the Qadhafi government and launched a failed rebellion. Qadhafi responded with a brutal crackdown that collectively punished the citizens of Derna, destroying development and exacerbating grievances that continue to be exploited by extremists. Local extremists blocked local residents from carrying out election for the Constitution Drafting Assembly.   

LTI is implementing clusters of visible, tangible community engagement projects that help to boost government legitimacy, bolster community security, and spark local-level change. By bringing together local authorities, civil society, and the private sector to deliver practical projects, these activities aim to build relationships among key stakeholders and improve confidence in the transition. The projects seek to empower moderate voices to ‘Think Nationally, Act Locally,” strengthen local resiliencies that reject extremism, and promote conflict-sensitive local development. 

Extremists groups in Derna are trying to recurit jobless youth age 14-26 who also have limited access to extracurricular activities. There are reports that extremist groups and militias are recruiting youth through afternoon activities such as shooting practice.  The youth currently using Al Najoum club are primarily from the neighborhood of Bab Tobruk, which is a moderate and middle class neighborhood in Derna that geographically borders on more extremist areas.  Because of the geographic proximity to extremist groups, youth from this area especially at risk from extremist messages.   This activity will provide these high school and university aged youth with a safe space to spend their time, thereby reducing their likelihood in engaging with destabilizing groups.  

This community engagement project follows on another grant benefiting the al-Najoum Sporting Club (BENG026) in which an agreement between the Derna Local Council (DLC) and LTI resulted in the procurement of the AstroTurf, poles, fencing and flood lights that supported the club’s development of its football pitch. This present activity will provide additional fencing, training equipment, and uniforms to the club, as well as paying for the first month rent for their training facilities.   The donated sports equipment will be placed in the rented facilities within walking distance of Al Najoum football pitch while the permanent space is under construction.  The club management will ask for a nominal fee from club members in order to cover the rent until the permanent space is ready.  

In order to promote the club to get youth to attend, the al-Najoum Club will organize a cleanup campgaing in Bab Tobruk to not just clean up the area but also to publisize the official launch of the club.  Football is a popular game in Libya and the World Cup will help further encourage youth to use the club and its football ptich. The club will also try to host games after iftars, which is traditionally a good time to engage communities.  Body building is popular in Libya, especially amonth the youth, so providing this type of equipment will help engage the target group.  In addition, the club will hold a public opening event.  Local government offiicals will be invited to the opening ceremony to meet with youth and their families and encourage them to join the club. The al-Najoum Sporting Club will also invite the national sport satellite TV, al Reiadiya to cover the launching event and local old-timer footballer match plan for the event.

The al-Najoum Sporting Club in Derna was established in 1984 as a result of community leaders’ efforts seeking to establish a community sporting center. At the time, the Libyan Youth & Sports authority   supported local community sporting centers, encouraging local residents from the district of Bab Tobruk in Derna to apply for a license to establish the club. The authorities issued the license in 1984, but the club never had its own proper training facilitates until LTI sponsored the revitalization of their soccer field through a grant agreement with the DLC in the late summer of 2013.

This activity supports civic activism in transition processes by increasing opportunities for representatives of civil society, government officials, and community members to interact.   Shahat City in Eastern Libya is relatively stable and had recent municipal council elections.  OTI will work with the prominent Sadaqa Sporting Club and the municipal council to revitalize the sports club as a means to promote the council as providing tangible change in the community.  Through the provision of sports equipment and materials for a civic tree planting campaign, this activity will host events where the municipal council can meet with local citizens as a means to start future dialogue.  By showcasing the municipal council in the media and in events, this activity will help lay the platform for citizens to work with their elected local council on issues related to Libya's transition.

",Engaging Youth: World Cup Viewings & Revitalizing a Local Sports Club in Shahat,"
Three years after the Libya revolution that overthrew Libya’s dictator, Muammar Qadhafi, the country’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap and is eroding support for the government as well as exacerbating grievances that extremists/spoilers are using as recruitment tools. 



However, some positive steps such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and the elections of the Constitution Drafting Assembly have taken place. Thus, there is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 



Located in eastern Libya’s Jebel Akdhar region, Shahat is 24k east of Bayda and has a population of approximately 43,000. Shahat is a strategic focus area for the Libya Transition Initiative due to its partners, proximity, stability, and visibility. First, LTI has already partnered with the strong Shahat Civil Society Network on an information center project, there is a very active women’s group headed by the newly elected Local Council Deputy Chairman, and there is a radio station that provides a platform for transition-related programming and reaches Derna. Second, the space between Shahat and Derna – Ras al-Hillal, Qubah, and the Jebel Akdar region generally – is believed to be the primary safe haven for extremists groups in the region. Combined with continued engagement in Derna, the Shahat cluster will frame this area and provide a strategic entry point into these surrounding areas. Third, Shahat is relatively secure platform that enables LTI to implement community improvement projects immediately that can generate models and momentum. Shahat was one of the first cities to have municipal elections, and LTI wants to support the new council members.  Finally, although it is relatively small, the Shahat region is popular destination with a high profile and large potential for tourism due to the presence of Greek ruins. Shahat’s rich heritage is also a very visible and potent counter-narrative to extremist groups who are attempting to rewrite Libya’s cultural history and identity.

LTI is implementing clusters of visible, tangible community engagement projects that help to boost government legitimacy, bolster community security, and spark local-level change. By bringing together local authorities, civil society, and the private sector to deliver practical projects like community parks and football fields, these activities aim to build relationships among key stakeholders and improve confidence in the transition. The projects seek to empower moderate voices to ‘Think Nationally, Act Locally,” strengthen local resiliencies that reject extremism, and promote conflict-sensitive local development. To maximize impact, LTI will work with local partners to ensure that there is a media plan in place to publicize and promote the projects.


The awardee is Shahat Sadaqa Sporting Club, which  was established in 1955, and today participates in the Libyan third national division football league with the volleyball and handball teams playing in the second national division league. In 1974, the entire club’s board of directors got arrested for illegal political activities against the Qadhafi regime.  The Sadaqa Sporting Club is currently one of the largest and most public sports clubs in Shahat, and has outreach and activities with other clubs in Derna, so activities taking place in the club are widely publicized.  


To capitalize on the club's prominence, LTI will coordinate with the club as a means to support the newly elected municipal council and provide them with opportunities to engage local citizens.  The local council was elected in December 2013, but have yet to receive a budget from the national government.  Therefore, they been able to demonstrate any change in the community or their responsivness to citizens' needs.  LTI wants to work with them on these types of projects to help them engage with citizens and boost the communities trust in the capability of their local government institutition 

LTI will provide the Shahat Sadaqa Sporting Club with equipment and help revitalize its sporting facilities.  Once the equipment is installed, LTI will host a large opening event with the club, at which municipal council members will attend as a means to help introduce them to the community.  The club's revitalization will be branded as the Municipal Council through the media and posters as a means to demonstrate positive changes that have occurred in Shahat since the election.  In addition to the opening ceremony, LTI will provide trees that can be planted in the area through a volunteer event coordinated by the sports club in which municipal council members will also participate.  LTI is planning a grant with a local media organization in Shahat and through that grant will publicize in both social and regular media  all community engagement actiities in the area.  LTI will also encouage the municipality, any other government body, and the club to advertise their coordination and the club opening and other events

This activity will help promote civic activism by providing opportunities for the Shahat municipal council, located in a stable city in Libya's volatile east, to reach out to local community members through public events and demonstrate the opportunities for change in a community.

Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya's transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

The birthplace of Libya's revolution, Benghazi has become a symbol of the transitions challenges. During the first quarter of 2014, nearly half of all recorded incidents of violence occurred in Benghazi. Targeted assassinations, calls for federalism, and expanding extremist influence are all symptomatic of underlying, unaddressed economic and political grievances. The government has stepped up security deployments, but Salafi groups like Ansar al-Sharia continue to clash with Special Forces and create instability. 

In order to counter the destabilizing trend of public disengagement, LTI is providing catalytic support to enable civil society to effectively participate in political processes as well as creating opportunities to impact their communities through ""Thinking Nationally, Act Locally"" initiatives. LTI is engaging politically marginalized and conflict vulnerable groups, and build their linkages with local and national government. To promote inclusive and informed participation in key political processes, LTI is supporting initiatives that raise awareness on critical issues, create opportunities for civil society to engage with government, and empower effective advocacy.

Attawasul Association is one of the nonprofit organization that started after the revolution with support from local downers to help families with need, immigrants from the western part of Libya and to develop programs that  protect women's and children's rights and emphasize women's role in a society of democratic institution . They have a good relationship with local organizations and Libyan media.

In partnership with the Benghazi Local Council and ACTED, Attawasul will implement a 3-day conference in Benghazi from 3rd to 5th of May, 2014. The goal of the conference is to discuss how youth can be positive leaders for practical change within their communities. The conference will include discussion on how youth can contribute to local development, improve access to education, enhance university education, and develop youth decision making and leadership skills. 

The third-day of the event will include discussion on youth participation in national dialogue initiatives. LTI's national dialogue civil society engagement STTA (TRIP087) will attend, as will members of the National Dialogue Preparatory Commission (NDPC). 

This activity assumes that by engaging youth in national initiatives like national dialogue and also improving their youth leadership skills, civic engagement in political processes will be enhanced as this is vital at a sensitive time in the Libyan transition and Benghazi in particular. The reason of doing this conference in Benghazi is to send a message of hope and resilience through this city after what this city had been through lately.

Under this DDGS activity, LTI 3 will establish a rapid response mechanism to procure and deliver commodity baskets to municipal authorities for distribution to up to 5,000 families in Sirte, as well as Sirte IDPs residing in Misrata and Tripoli. Since their return to Sirte, families have suffered a lack of access to basic goods and services. Sirte IDPs who are still residing away from Sirte are also not able to provide for their families. To allow for fair and organized distribution, Sirte Crisis Committee’s database, the Scouts and LRC’s reliable networks will be used by LTI3 municipal partners to distribute the commodity baskets at distribution centers located in Sirte, Misrata and Tripoli. LTI3 partners will promote USAID and its role in this activity through branded printed materials and formal and social media outlets.  LTI3 support will increase the effectiveness of municipal authorities’ in service delivery and addressing Sirte recovery needs.

",Commodity Baskets for Vulnerable Families,"
The Islamic State (IS) emerged in 2015 in the midst of Libya’s governance vacuum. A local jihadi group, Ansar Al-Sharia, pledged allegiance to IS in Syria and Iraq and established the “Tripoli Province” of the Islamic State by taking control of territory in and around Sirte, where Islamist and jihadist trends developed after the city was marginalized for its ties to former Libyan leader Muammar Al Qaddafi and its anti-revolution sentiment. By early 2016, IS was in full control of Sirte and its surrounding areas and instituting its strict interpretation of sharia law. As a result, the Sirte area became isolated from the rest of Libya, leading to shortages of food, money, and medicine.  Austere living conditions and fighting caused most of central Sirte’s residents to flee to other cities along the coast. In mid-2016, a primarily Misratan force calling itself Al-Bunyan Al-Marsous (ABAM) launched ground operations military operations to liberate Sirte and the surrounding towns from IS control, and the U.S. later supported this effort with airstrikes.  ABAM forces liberated Sirte in late 2016, and has violence tapered off in early 2017, Sirte’s internally displaced persons started returning.  Due to lack of resources and technical capacity, Sirte’s elected municipal council (SMC) and relevant municipal and national authorities are struggling to address the huge needs of Sirte’s recovery and ensure access to basic services and needs for its residents.On the municipal and local level, and in addition to the Sirte MC, there are several entities who have been working to lessen the effects of the conflict in Sirte, including its residents and IDPs, such as the Libyan Red Crescent (LRC) and the Scouts, a reputable, Libyan non-political organization that has been playing a key role in relief efforts around Libya and in helping to manage the social dislocation the Libyan conflict has caused. Additionally, to mitigate the crisis on Sirte IDPs, the Ministry of Social Affairs has established the Sirte Crisis Committee (SCC). The committee employees developed a database to collect all Sirte IDP family names and national identification numbers voluntarily. This database keeps track of Sirte IDP movements and has allowed for an organized and fair distribution of aid by governmental entities and international humanitarian organizations in many areas such as Tripoli and the outskirts of the Sirte region. In 2016, LTI 3 partnered with the Abu Salim MC, SCC, LRC and other MCs and successfully distributed approximately 900 food baskets to Sirte IDPs, residing in Tripoli, during the month of Ramadan.   In this difficult situation and with the fasting month of Ramadan approaching this year, many Sirte residents and IDPs are unable to provide for themselves, creating an urgent need for food supplies. To respond to this critical need, LTI 3 will source, procure and deliver commodity baskets to relevant local authorities including but not limited to the SMC, Misrata MC and Abu Salim MC for onward distribution to Sirte families residing in Sirte, Misrata and Tripoli. LTI3 support will also include outreach and media materials and services to promote the efforts of the partner municipal authorities and USAID in responding to the needs of the Sirte community. The provision of this support will increase the effectiveness of relevant municipal authorities in service delivery.

Through this highly visible activity, LTI3 is supporting Sirte MC to reactivate Sirte Radio Station, the only local radio outlet in Sirte, to resume broadcasting. The radio station was one of the first public facilities seized by the Islamic State in 2015, and militants used the station to promote its extremist ideology before looting and eventually shutting it down. Sirte MC identified reactivating Sirte Radio Station as a recovery priority for both practical and symbolic reasons. Through this activity, Sirte MC, in coordination with the MoLG and Ministry of Culture, will restore a priority public service and support recovery and return to normalcy after liberation from Islamic State occupation. LTI3 will provide in-kind support in the form of radio broadcasting equipment, office equipment and furniture, internet and outreach materials to highlight the intervention. Additionally, Sirte MC will conduct an information campaign to raise awareness about the council's work to provide services and support recovery efforts. By helping Sirte MC respond to a community priority, this effort will help build the legitimacy of the elected council in the eyes of its constituents.
","
If Sirte MC provides the required equipment, materials, and internet access to restore functionality to the Sirte Radio Station, THEN residents of Sirte will have increased awareness of the ability of the Sirte elected MC to provide critical services because:1. Sirte citizens want a local radio station that will cover local news and affairs in Sirte. 2. Local authorities (Sirte MC) in Sirte region and GNA ministries (such as the MoLG and ministry of Culture) lack resources to reactivate the radio station but have an interest in doing so.3. Citizens of Sirte want to see visible progress from the MC in providing basic services and supporting recovery. 4. Highly visible service delivery projects by the MC are viewed favorably by citizens.
",Bring Sirte Radio Station Back to Life!,"
The Islamic State (IS) emerged in 2015 in the midst of Libya’s governance vacuum. A local jihadi group, Ansar Al-Sharia, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and established the “Tripoli Province” of the so-called Caliphate by taking control of Sirte and surrounding areas. Islamist and jihadist trends emerged in Sirte because the city, Muammar Al Qaddafi’s birthplace, was marginalized and stigmatized after the revolution due to its pro-Qaddafi sentiments.  Islamic State militants successfully exploited local grievances and conflicts to consolidate their footprint in the Sirte region. By early 2016, IS was in full control of central Sirte and its surrounding areas.The extremist group terrorized residents by imposing its draconian interpretation of sharia law, conducting public lashings and executions, eventually looting and destroying the city. Sirte became isolated from the rest of Libya, leading to shortages of food, money, and medicine. Oppression, austere living conditions and clashes caused most of central Sirte’s 100,000 residents to flee to other cities along the coast. 
In mid-2016, a primarily Misratan force calling itself Al-Bunyan Al-Marsous (ABAM) launched ground operations to liberate Sirte and surrounding towns from IS control, and the U.S. later supported this effort with airstrikes.  After 8-months of military operations against IS, the Government of National Accord (GNA) announced on December 17, 2016 the liberation of Sirte from IS control. The IS occupation, along with intensive urban warfare to liberate the city, damaged and destroyed thousands of homes, businesses, schools, health clinics and other public infrastructure, which has slowed IDP returns. 
The Sirte Radio Station was one of the first public facilities Islamic State militants seized in the city. One of the first widely circulated photos of the IS consolidating control in Sirte depicted masked, Kalashnikov wielding militants taking control of the radio station, which the group used to promote its extremist ideology.  IS later looted and shut down the station. Restoring the Sirte Radio Station will provide elected local authorities with a means to better communicate with the local populace about recovery efforts, and will serve as a powerful symbol that life is returning to normal in the city.  
Sirte Municipal Council (MC) was elected in May 2014 and its current Mayor was confirmed in December 2016. Though the mayor has lobbied for national resources to lead rehabilitation efforts in Sirte, the country's political divisions and crippling economic crisis have slowed progress with recovery.  Local authorities in Sirte quickly identified reactivating Sirte Radio Station as a practical and symbolic priority, but lack the resources to restore its functionality despite its significance to local residents.  The inability of Sirte MC to restore services in the battered city has undermined its legitimacy among returning families and those that remain displaced.
In this highly visible activity, LTI3 will provide Sirte MC in-kind support to reactivate Sirte Radio Station, the only local radio station in the city. The activity will provide the station with radio broadcasting equipment, office equipment and furniture, and internet. This activity will allow the Sirte MC to restore the only local radio outlet for Sirte residents, a key achievement to return to normalcy in Sirte. Furthermore, LTI3 will support a strong outreach campaign to promote the SMC’s efforts to restore services in Sirte.

Through this activity, LTI3 is supporting Sirte MC to provide the OESCS, the education office providing services for 33 schools in Sirte, with equipment and materials. The education sector is one of the main sectors that IS militants distorted and controlled in Sirte in order to spread its extremist ideology. Sirte MC identified improving the OESCS' services as a recovery priority for Sirte. Through this activity, Sirte MC, in coordination with the Ministry of Education, will improve a priority public service and support recovery and return to normalcy after liberation from IS occupation. LTI3 will provide in-kind support in the form of IT equipment, office equipment and materials and outreach materials to highlight the intervention. Additionally, Sirte MC will conduct an information campaign to raise awareness about the council's work to provide services and support recovery efforts. By helping Sirte MC respond to a community priority, this effort will help strengthen confidence in the elected council in the eyes of its constituents.
","
If Sirte MC provides the required equipment and materials to improve the OESCS’ services, THEN residents of Sirte will have increased awareness of the ability of the Sirte elected MC to provide critical services because:
1. Sirte citizens want the OESCS to provide services for schools in Sirte. 
2. Local authorities (Sirte MC) in Sirte region and GNA ministries (such as the Ministry of Education) lack resources to support the OESCS but have an interest in doing so.
3. Citizens of Sirte want to see visible progress from the MC in providing basic services and supporting recovery. 
4. Service delivery projects by the MC are viewed favorably by citizens.


",Supporting Sirte Education Sector,"
The Islamic State (IS) emerged in 2015 in the midst of Libya’s governance vacuum. A local jihadi group, Ansar Al-Sharia, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and established the “Tripoli Province” of the so-called Caliphate by taking control of Sirte and surrounding areas. Islamist and jihadist trends emerged in Sirte because the city, Muammar Al Qaddafi’s birthplace, was marginalized and stigmatized after the revolution due to its pro-Qaddafi sentiments.  Islamic State militants successfully exploited local grievances and conflicts to consolidate their footprint in the Sirte region. By early 2016, IS was in full control of central Sirte and its surrounding areas. The extremist group terrorized residents by imposing its draconian interpretation of sharia law, conducting public lashings and executions, eventually looting and destroying the city. Sirte became isolated from the rest of Libya, leading to shortages of food, money, and medicine. Oppression, austere living conditions and clashes caused most of central Sirte’s 100,000 residents to flee to other cities along the coast. 
In mid-2016, a primarily Misratan force calling itself Al-Bunyan Al-Marsous (ABAM) launched ground operations to liberate Sirte and surrounding towns from IS control, and the U.S. later supported this effort with airstrikes.  After 8-months of military operations against IS, the Government of National Accord (GNA) announced on December 17, 2016 the liberation of Sirte from IS control. The IS occupation, along with intensive urban warfare to liberate the city, damaged and destroyed thousands of homes, businesses, schools, health clinics and other public infrastructure, which has slowed IDP returns. 
The education sector was one of the main sectors that IS militants altered and controlled after controlling Sirte. IS replaced the formal educational curriculum with curriculum to promote its extremist ideology and damaged numerous educational facilities throughout the region. One of the damaged facilities is the Office of Educational Services in Central Sirte (OESCS), which serves 24 elementary schools (with over 12,000 students) and nine high schools (with over 2,000 students). The OESCS provides services such as managing school exams and printing and distributing exam papers to schools. Providing the OESCS building with office equipment and materials will improve the OESCS’ ability to deliver educational services to Sirte schools in the upcoming academic year and will prove to the community that life is returning to normal in the city.  
Sirte Municipal Council (MC) was elected in May 2014 and its current Mayor was confirmed in December 2016. Though the mayor has lobbied for national resources to lead rehabilitation efforts in Sirte, the country's political divisions and crippling economic crisis have slowed progress with recovery.  Local authorities in Sirte quickly identified supporting the OESCS as a priority, but lack the resources to support it despite the importance of its services. The inability of Sirte MC to restore services in the battered city has undermined its legitimacy among returning families and those that remain displaced.
In this activity, LTI3 will provide Sirte MC in-kind support to improve the OESCS’ ability to deliver educational services to Sirte schools. The activity will provide the SMC with IT equipment, office equipment and supplies for the use by the OESCS. This activity will allow the Sirte MC to improve the ability of the OESCS to provide services to Sirte schools, a key achievement to return to normalcy in Sirte. Furthermore, LTI3 will support a strong outreach campaign to promote the SMC’s efforts to restore services in Sirte.

This activity seeks to improve economic opportunities for farmers in Harawa by accelerating the recovery of the agriculture sector. Harawa is located 75km East of Sirte and was occupied by IS before being liberated in 2016. The Harawa Municipal Council has prioritized reviving the agriculture sector as an important part to return to normalcy and encourage farmers to go back to their lands. ""The Great Man Made River, Harawa Main Storage Tank"", provides water to areas located in central Libya. Seventy farms benefited from this tank prior to the 2011 revolution, however due to lack of periodic inspection to these pumps after the revolution, six out of the eight pumps that operate the tank have stopped working according to the Harawa Municipal Council. This has compelled farmers to leave their lands. With support from USAID/OTI, the MC of Harawa will replace the six damaged pumps and publicize their efforts via social media. The provision of this assistance will contribute to accelerating early recovery and return to normalcy in an strategic area that was controlled by extremist groups. 


","
IF we support Harawa MC to install 6 centrifugal pumps for the water tank station, and implement an outreach campaign then we will restore access to water for farmers and encourage them to return to their lands. 

BECAUSE: 
1 - Farmers in Harawa are willing and able to return to their lands and resume farming if provided with water.
2 - There is a sufficient level of security/stability for farmers to resume their farming. 
3 - Public outreach efforts announcing the resumption of irrigation in Harawa will reach displaced farmers, vendors, and the wider community, this will help in making the activity more visible to let Herawa communities who've been displaced or not around in the affected areas more aware of the project achievements. 

",Revive Agriculture & Farming In Harawa,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Fragile and poorly maintained infrastructure causes major services disruptions, which, in what used to be an upper middle income country, contributes to widespread anger and perceptions of marginalization. Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, carjacking, and clashes.  Discussion of democratic transition is now limited mostly to elites, while average citizens speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival.  The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing unrest, angst and instability from crossing a point of no return.The Islamic State (IS) emerged in 2015 in the midst of Libya’s governance vacuum and established the “Tripoli Province” of the so-called Caliphate by taking control of Sirte and surrounding areas.

After 8-months of Al-Bunyan Al-Marsous (ABAM)-led military operations and U.S airstrikes against IS, the Government of National Accord (GNA) announced on December 17, 2016 the liberation of Sirte from IS control. The city of Harawa is one of Sirte's outlying towns and is located 75 km East of Sirte center. IS occupied Harawa for a brief period during the conflict and looted or damaged many of its public facilities. Harawa Municipal Council resumed operations in June 2016, and since then many of the town's residents have started returning. In Harawa and other Sirte basin towns, the conflict decimated the local economy. Public and private economic actors, vendors, and businesses fled Harawa in search of safety and stability elsewhere. Market, industrial, and commercial areas sustained damage to their infrastructure, further complicating the return of businesses. As residents return, economic regeneration opportunities are an important part of return-to-normalcy, which the municipal council is well-poised to assist with. In Herawa specifically, farming is an important sector in the local economy. Issue: ""The Great Man Made River, Harawa Main Storage Tank"", provides water to areas located in central Libya. The storage tank has eight centrifugal pumps and three main supply routes including Harawa route (35km long), Wadi Al-Halli (13km long), and Wadi El-Amra (25km long). In Harawa, 70 farms benefited from this tank prior to the 2011 revolution, which enabled them to grow different types of fruits and vegetables that were sold at the local markets in Harawa and other cities in Libya. However due to lack of periodic inspection to these pumps after the revolution, six out of the eight pumps have stopped working according to the Harawa Municipal Council. This has affected the water pressure and prevented water from reaching the farms. As a result, farmers were compelled to leave their lands. The water problem is also discouraging farmers from returning to their lands after liberation.Why: Though the Harawa Municipal Council has lobbied for national resources to lead rehabilitation efforts, the country's political divisions and crippling economic crisis have slowed progress with recovery. The MC and the local community are trying to revive the various economic sectors in the city including the agriculture sector, as an important component of return to normalcy, however they lack the resources to do so. By supporting the Harawa Municipal Council, LTI 3 will contribute to accelerating the early recovery and return to normalcy in an area that was once controlled by IS.Who/Where: The activity will be led by the Harawa Municipal Council located in Center of Libya, this elected council showed good responses in previously implemented grants in LTI2 in terms of outreaching for the community, this is very important in this grant as it plays a big part on making this project success because we need to contact anyone who's been affected by water shortages even in or outside of the district. The grantee also has authorization over the public water company to do installation as part of their contribution, which local CSOs won't be able to do that How/What: In this activity, LTI 3 will support the Harawa MC to install and replace the six damaged centrifugal pumps located of the ""Great Man River Water Tank"" station. After installation, the MC will resume pumping to Harawa Farms. The MC will use their official social media page to publicize the project and reach out to farmers. Furthermore, LTI3 will support an outreach campaign led my MC once installation finishes to make the activity more visible for Herawa community.

Through this highly visible activity, LTI3 is supporting the Sirte MC to restore the Sirte Scouts Regiment HQ in order to help the Scouts conduct a variety of community-based initiatives to support recovery in the liberated city. Sirte MC identified SSR HQ as a recovery priority for both practical and symbolic reasons. Through this activity with a highly visible, respected, and non-partisan civic institution, the Sirte MC will support the SSR and accelerate recovery and return to normalcy after liberation from Islamic State occupation. LTI3 will provide in-kind support in the form of IT equipment, office equipment and furniture, internet, temporary office space and outreach materials to highlight the intervention. Additionally, the Sirte MC will conduct an information campaign to raise awareness about the council's work to restore services and support moderate community actors.

IF we support the Sirte Scouts Regiment in rehabilitating its headquarters in collaboration with the Sirte MC, THEN the volume of community-based activities supporting recovery and return to normalcy will increase BECAUSE: 

1. We assume Sirte Scouts want to conduct community-based recovery activities.2. We assume the lack of an operational capacity for Sirte Scouts headquarters is limiting their ability to conduct activities.3. We assume a lack of positive civic activities risks undermining support for the Sirte MC, especially among youth who have previously been targeted for recruitment by extremist organizations.4. We assume the local authorities (SMC) in Sirte region and GNA ministries (such as the MoYS) don’t have enough resources to rehabilitate the Scouts’ headquarters but want to support their activities in the community.  5. We assume Sirte Scouts have resources and support to conduct some activities independently once the headquarters is operational again. 6. We assume that rehabilitating the headquarters will be a highly visible symbol to the community that the recovery effort in Sirte is gaining momentum

Though the mayor has lobbied for national resources to lead rehabilitation efforts in Sirte, the country's political divisions and crippling economic crisis have slowed progress with recovery. Local activists from the city identified supporting Sirte Scouts Regiment (SSR) as a practical and symbolic priority, but lack the resources to restore the Scouts HQ to functionality despite its significance to local residents. The inability of Sirte MC to restore services in the battered city has undermined its legitimacy among returning families and those that remain displaced.
Issue: One of the damaged public facilities is the Scouts headquarters, which is the home for one of the most active community actors in Sirte community development. IS took over the Scouts HQ during their occupation of Sirte, looting and destroying equipment and office furniture. In addition, some parts of the building were burned from fire and explosions during the military operation to oust IS from Sirte in 2016. Based on an assessment from the LTI3 engineer, the building would require extensive testing and construction in order to ensure that it is safe to return to safe public use. Due to the country's ongoing political issues, economic crisis and overall insecurity, local and national authorities (e.g. GNA, SMC), lack the resources to help the Scouts re-establish their operations and get their HQ up and running again. 
Why: Without the Scouts functioning, Sirte is missing a key civil society actor that has broad public support and the ability to mobilize people for recovery and normalization efforts. By supporting the Scouts to become operational again, LTI 3 will re-establish a reliable partner that can conduct a large range of basic civic and service delivery activities that will speed up the effort to get Sirte back on its feet and demonstrate to residents that there are vehicles for them to participate and accelerate recovery efforts.
Who/Where: The activity will focus on supporting Scouts organization in Sirte and their members.
How/What: In this highly visible activity, LTI3 will provide Sirte MC in-kind support to restore SSR HQ. This activity will provide the SSR with IT equipment, office equipment and furniture, internet, and temporary office space. This activity will allow also the Sirte MC to be vocal and visible in supporting moderate community actors and increasing youth engagement in the community, a key goal to return to normalcy in Sirte. Furthermore, LTI3 will support an outreach campaign to promote the SMC’s efforts in supporting youth and local NGOs.

The Civil Registry Office of Central Sirte (CROCS) among other governmental entities in the city were controlled by IS during their occupation of Sirte, and equipment from the CROCS was looted. The CROCS serves around 80,000 Sirte residents and is currently operating with very limited capacity.
Why: The inability of SMC to effectively respond to Sirte recovery priorities and restore services has undermined its legitimacy and slowed down recovery and return to normalcy. Local authorities in Sirte identified supporting the CROCS to restore its full capacity as a priority, but lack the resources to support it despite the importance of its services. The CROCS provides services such as include issuing national numbers, marriage documents, family booklets, birth certificates, death certificates, grave permissions, and family status papers. These documents are prerequisites for citizens to access many critical public services such as medical and educational services.  Restoring a critical public service will encourage more IDPs to return to Sirte, and accelerate recovery and return to normalcy for those who do. Supporting an outreach campaign by the SMC to highlight its role in restoring the CROCS will help reinforce its legitimacy.

Under this DDGS activity, LTI 3 will establish a rapid response mechanism to procure and deliver school kits to relevant local, municipal and national authorities for onward distribution to up to 29,500 students across the Sirte region, as well as Sirte IDPs residing in Misrata. During its occupation of Sirte, IS controlled the education sector, altered curriculum, and closed or exploited schools to promote its extremist ideology. Due to its high cost, providing school kits for students is key to encourage Sirte residents and IDPs to send their children back to school. To allow for organized distribution, the OESCS and Ministry of Social Affairs’ databases will be used by LTI3 partners to distribute the school kits at the targeted schools. LTI3, in coordination with its partners, will promote USAID and its role in this activity through branded printed press release on social media outlets.  This activity will contribute to accelerated early recovery efforts and return to normalcy in Sirte.

Issue: IS occupation, along with intensive urban warfare to liberate Sirte, damaged and destroyed thousands of homes, businesses, schools, health clinics and most of the city’s public infrastructure. The Sirte Municipal Council (SMC), elected in May 2014 and its mayor, confirmed in December 2016, has lobbied for resources from the national government to lead rehabilitation efforts in Sirte, the country's political divisions and crippling economic crisis have slowed progress with recovery. The education sector was one of the main sectors that IS militants controlled during their Sirte occupation. IS altered the educational curriculum to promote its extremist ideology and damaged numerous educational facilities throughout the region. The restoration of recognized governance institutions' support for education services will signal a return to normalcy. 
Why: Authorities identified restoring the education sector as a recovery priority in the Sirte region, however they lack the resources to respond to this urgent recovery need. Providing school kits (school bag, uniform and stationary) for students to return to schools is key to encourage Sirte families to send their children to school when the new academic year starts, which in turn affects economic recovery opportunities for parents. The cost of school bags, uniform and stationary is high and many Sirte families cannot afford to buy these items for their children, nor can they access currency due to crippled banking institutions.
Who/where: Relevant local, municipal and national level authorities make the most appropriate partner here because they are already responsible for this type of service provision in the Sirte region and Misrata. They will include SMC, the Office of Educational Services in Central Sirte (OESCS), Abu Grain and Al-Whishka Local Councils, Herawa MC (HMC), Ministry of Education (MoE), Ministry of Social Affairs. 
How/what: Through this DDGS activity, LTI 3 will source, procure and deliver school kits (including school bag, uniform and stationary) to relevant local, municipal and national authorities for onward distribution to Sirte resident and IDP elementary and intermediate-level school students, in order to incentivize their return to school this academic year. LTI3 support will also include outreach and media materials and services to promote the efforts of the partner authorities and USAID in responding to the recovery needs of the Sirte community.

Through this activity, LTI3 is supporting SMC and General Company for Water and Sewage Sirte Service Office (GSWC-SSO) with pumps and spare parts to manage the sewage system in Sirte city. Years of war and IS occupation left Sirte’s sewage system facilities subject to destruction, looting and neglect, with poor maintenance compounding the problem. As a result, Sirte suffers from major overflow of sewage in residential areas, spread of insects and diseases, contamination of aquafer water, and displacement of residents. In response, LTI3 will provide in-kind support in the form of pumps and spare parts to reactivate the network, making affected neighborhoods more livable, thus increasing the likelihood that returnees will stay. In addition, an awareness campaign will highlight the importance of the community role in maintaining a healthy sewage system. This will contribute to LTI3’s efforts to accelerate recovery in Sirte.
","
IF: The GCWS-SSO and SMC reactivate 7 sewage pumps in SirteTHEN: returnees to affected neighborhoods will be more likely to stay.   BECAUSE:- Current and future sewage problems in central Sirte keeps life in the city very far from normal and unlivable as residents experience decreased mobility and increased risk of disease.- Seeing governance institutions and the street/sewage workers visibly respond to the issues around the city will reinforce the image of normal Sirte.- Improvements in the sewage system will be sufficient to reverse sewage overflow in a sustainable manner.- An awareness campaign to highlight the community role in maintaining a healthy sewage system is needed because that further encourages returnees to stay in their areas and feel hopeful about Sirte recovery
",Supporting Sirte to Solve its Sewage Problem,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Fragile and poorly maintained infrastructure causes major services disruptions, which, in what used to be an upper middle-income country, contributes to widespread anger and perceptions of marginalization.  Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, carjacking, and clashes. Discussion of democratic transition is now limited mostly to elites, while average citizens speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival.  The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing unrest, angst and instability from crossing a point of no return.
Where: Sirte City. The Islamic State (IS) emerged in 2015 during Libya’s governance vacuum and established the “Tripoli Province” of the so-called Caliphate by taking control of Sirte and surrounding areas. Islamic State militants successfully exploited local grievances and conflicts to consolidate their footprint in the Sirte region. By early 2016, IS was in full control of central Sirte and its surrounding areas. Sirte became isolated from the rest of Libya, leading to shortages of food, money, and medicine. Oppression, austere living conditions and clashes caused most of central Sirte’s 100,000 residents to flee to other cities along the coast. After eight months of Al-Bunyan Al-Marsous (ABAM)-led military operations and U.S airstrikes against IS, the Government of National Accord (GNA) announced the liberation of Sirte from IS control on December 17, 2016. 
Issue: Years of war and IS occupation left Sirte’s sewage infrastructure subject to destruction, looting and neglect. Poor maintenance and absence of spare parts compounded the problem. The city’s sewage system consists of three sewage pumping stations, one storm water pumping station and a sewage treatment plant. Out of  the 16 boosting pumps in these facilities, only 2 are functioning. Consequently, Sirte suffers from overflow in residential areas, spread of insects and diseases, contamination of aquafer water, and displacement of Sirte residents as a result. The Government of Libya faces several financial, political and security challenges that hinder its ability to support SMC and the General Company for Water and Sewage Sirte Service Office (GSWC-SSO)  to solve this sewage problem.
Who: LTI3 grantee under this activity is the Sirte Municipal Council (SMC). SMC was elected in May 2014 and its current Mayor was confirmed in December 2016. The MC is the predominant governance authority expected by the population to mobilize recovery efforts as the country’s national government is paralyzed by political divisions and economic crises. During the implementation of this activity, LTI3 will also work with the General Company for Water and Sewage Sirte Service Office (GSWC-SSO) and General Electric Company (GEC), state-owned companies, to ensure successful technical planning and implementation of the activity. 
Why: Restoring the full functionality of the sewage system will address the current major sewage overflow and will prevent future major sewage overflows in several parts of the city such as Neighborhood 3 and 1000-Residential Units areas. Through this assistance, LTI3 will help SMC and GCWS-SSO to better manage the sewage crisis, which will prevent residents from leaving their areas and encourage IDPs to return. This will accelerate recovery and return to normalcy in Sirte. 
How: In this activity, LTI3 will provide SMC with in-kind support to procure and deliver 7 new pumps and spare parts and promote a public awareness campaign to highlight the importance of the community role in maintaining the sewage system. LTI3 support under this activity constitutes the minimum requirements to reactivate the sewage system that covers all neighborhoods in Sirte city. LTI3 may provide additional support under future activities to address all the requirements needed to fully fix the city sewage system.

This activity seeks to support the Sirte Municipal Council to create a sense of return to normalcy among Sirte returnees by restoring facets of rule of law . During IS occupation- and the resulting military campaign to eradicate it from Sirte-  traffic lights, speed bumps, and several road signs in the city were either damaged or looted. Damaged traffic lights, signs, speed bumps are scars of war that are hindering the Sirte Traffic Force's ability to enforce traffic laws that prevents return of order to the streets and a sense of normalcy for returnees. LTI3 will support the SMC to repair and replace damaged traffic lights and install new traffic lights at up to 16 key intersections in Sirte city. Additionally, a public awareness campaign on traffic rules and safe driving will be conducted as part of this activity to promote the role of the traffic force. Through this support, LTI3 will help SMC and Sirte Traffic Force to establish order in the streets in Sirte, therefore improving returnees' ability to go about their day-to-day business safely and more efficiently. This activity will contribute to early recovery efforts and return to normalcy in Sirte.
","
IF SMC supports improvements in traffic infrastructure,
THEN more order in the streets will be established, 
BECAUSE:
- The Sirte Traffic Force is already proactive in returning to work (compared to other authorities), but are not fully functional due to environmental considerations like traffic infrastructure damage and neglect.
- The 16 intersections identified by the traffic force are in fact key, and improvements will have a positive ripple effect on traffic management in other areas.
- New infrastructure and resumption of traffic force duties at key intersections will be highly visible, as it removes noticeable scars of war.
- A traffic safety campaign as part of the activity will further amplify visibility of the infrastructure improvements and traffic force's role.
",Supporting Sirte Traffic System,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, carjacking, and clashes, and they now speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival rather than democratic transition. The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing angst and instability from crossing a point of no return. 
The Islamic State (IS) emerged in 2015’s governance vacuum, successfully exploiting local grievances and conflicts to consolidate their footprint in the Sirte region, thus establishing their North African base. IS were in full control of central Sirte by early 2016. Sirte became isolated from the rest of Libya, leading to shortages of food, money, and medicine. Oppression, austere living conditions and clashes caused most of central Sirte’s 100,000 residents to flee. After an eight-month campaign reliant on Misratan forces and US airpower, the Government of National Accord (GNA) announced Sirte’s liberation in December 2016. While a majority of the displaced have returned to Sirte, the infrastructure and social fabric are in disrepair, making Libya’s center particularly vulnerable and unstable. 
Sirte Municipal Council (SMC) was elected in May 2014 and its current Mayor was confirmed in December 2016. Though the mayor has lobbied for national resources to lead rehabilitation efforts in Sirte, the country's political divisions and crippling economic crisis have slowed progress with recovery. The MC is the predominant governance authority expected by the population to mobilize recovery efforts.
Sirte’s poorly functioning traffic system is impeding the city’s return to normalcy. During IS occupation - and the resulting military campaign to eradicate it from the Sirte -  traffic lights, speed bumps, and several road signs in the city were either damaged or looted. The city center is currently experiencing  an increase in population density, which has resulted in severe traffic congestion and disorganization at 16 key intersections in the city center. This is anticipated to worsen with the start of the school year, when parents will be driving their children to school during rush hour.
Even though the Sirte Traffic Force was the only rule of law enforcement body that resumed its duties after the city was liberated from IS, it has been unable to adequately carry out its mandate in the absence of much needed infrastructure repair, resources, and equipment. Making improvements to the traffic infrastructure will allow the Sirte Traffic Force to perform its duties and address the traffic problem. In turn, improvements in the traffic system will improve perceptions of recovery among Sirte returnees, and facilitate the gradual return to normalcy in the city.  
With support from USAID/OTI, the Sirte MC will install new traffic lights and make repairs to damaged (but otherwise functional) ones and promote a public awareness campaign about road traffic safety and rules of the road, as well as the Sirte MC's role in facilitating a return to normalcy in the city. Through this assistance, LTI3 will help Sirte MC and Sirte Traffic Force to establish order in the streets of Sirte and remove scars of war, which will improve residents' ability to go about their day-to-day business safely and more efficiently. This will accelerate recovery and return to normalcy in Sirte.

Through this activity, LTI3 is supporting Sirte MC with with office materials, supplies and equipment for the MC’s Project Unit office (PU) located in Sirte MC building. During Sirte occupation, IS militants looted and destroyed the city’s public facilities and replaced the formal local and municipal government institutions with militants to rule the city and impose extremist ideology and practices on the community. Through this activity, Sirte MC will provide its PU and staff with materials, supplies and equipment to improve their effectiveness. LTI3 will provide in-kind support in the form of IT equipment, engineering surveying and assessment equipment materials and office equipment and supplies. Additionally, the SMC-PU staff will conduct site visits in Sirte, as part of training on the surveying and assessment equipment. These site visits will be videotaped and broadcast-ed to raise awareness about the MC's work to provide services and support recovery efforts. By helping Sirte MC to provide adequate resources to improve its PU staff’s effectiveness, this effort will help increase citizens’ awareness of its efforts to effectively address their priorities.

If the SMC reactivates its project Unit (PU) ,Then: 
Sirte people's awareness of the SMC's efforts to providing services and address recovery needs will be improved.
Because:
-The SMC has not been responsive enough because it lacked the means to comprehensively assess recovery needs.
​- The PU will sufficiently allow the SMC to better understand community needs and priorities. 
-The SMC will utilize PU findings to communicate recovery priorities and to mobilize funding and support.

After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Fragile and poorly maintained infrastructure causes major services disruptions, which, in what used to be an upper middle income country, contributes to widespread anger and perceptions of marginalization.  Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, carjacking, and clashes.  Discussion of democratic transition is now limited mostly to elites, while average citizens speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival.  The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing unrest, angst and instability from crossing a point of no return.
The Islamic State (IS) emerged in 2015 in the midst of Libya’s governance vacuum and established the “Tripoli Province” of the so-called Caliphate by taking control of Sirte and surrounding areas. Islamist and jihadist trends emerged in Sirte because the city, Muammar Al Qaddafi’s birthplace, was marginalized and stigmatized after the revolution due to its pro-Qaddafi sentiments.  Islamic State militants successfully exploited local grievances and conflicts to consolidate their footprint in the Sirte region. By early 2016, IS was in full control of central Sirte and its surrounding areas. The extremist group terrorized residents by imposing its draconian interpretation of sharia law, conducting public lashings and executions, eventually looting and destroying the city. Sirte became isolated from the rest of Libya, leading to shortages of food, money, and medicine. Oppression, austere living conditions and clashes caused most of central Sirte’s 100,000 residents to flee to other cities along the coast. After eight months of Al-Bunyan Al-Marsous (ABAM)-led military operations and U.S airstrikes against IS, the Government of National Accord (GNA) announced the liberation of Sirte from IS control on December 17, 2016. 
Issue: IS occupation, along with intensive urban warfare to liberate Sirte, damaged and destroyed thousands of homes, businesses, schools, health clinics and most of the city’s public infrastructure, which has slowed IDP returns. Though Sirte Municipal Council (SMC), elected in May 2014 and its mayor, confirmed in December 2016, has lobbied for resources from the national government to lead rehabilitation efforts in Sirte, the country's political divisions and crippling economic crisis have slowed progress with recovery. 
One of the damaged facilities is the Sirte MC building, which hosts the MC’s offices responsible to provide public services including the Projects Unit office (SMC-PU). The SMC-PU duties include conducting engineering surveys for damaged building and needs assessments across Sirte. These surveys and assessments are used by the SMC’s services offices and international donors assisting in Sirte recovery. Currently, SMC-PU staff--architects and civil engineers--don’t have the equipment and materials required to efficiently perform their day to day work. As a result, the SMC-PU have to pay private engineers/offices to conduct engineering surveys. This affects the SMC's ability to work efficiently and address Sirte recovery needs.  
Why: The inability of SMC to effectively respond to Sirte recovery priorities and restore services has undermined its legitimacy and slowed down recovery. SMC identified supporting its Projects Unit as a priority to improve its capacity, but lack the resources to support it despite the importance of its services. The SMC-PU work include conducting engineering surveys’ for damaged building and needs assessments across Sirte. These products are prerequisites for any rehab or service delivery efforts in Sirte. Providing SMC-PU with office equipment, IT equipment and engineering surveys’ and assessments equipment will improve the SMC’s ability to assess community needs and more effectively respond to Sirte community and recovery needs.
Who/where: SMC-PU in Sirte city. SMC-PU conducts engineering and needs assessments, and liaison between SMC various offices and government and non-government entities with regard to planning and implementing service delivery projects in Sirte. In the absence of a specialized office, SMC-PU is currently also responsible for coordinating with national bodies and international donors operating in Sirte.  
How/what: The activity aims to help SMC to effectively provide services to Sirte community. LTI3 will support SMC-PU with IT equipment, office equipment and supplies and engineering survey equipment to provide its staff with adequate resources to efficiently preform their day to day work. Additionally, LTI3 will support SMC-PU with materials to help its staff to conduct site visits, as well as training on the surveying and assessment equipment. These site visits will be documented via video to highlight the SMC’s efforts to address community and recovery needs.

Through this activity, LTI3 seeks to accelerate Sirte recovery and a return to normalcy by supporting the SCC to resume regular garbage collection and disposal. LTI3 will provide the SCC, a state-owned services company responsible for waste management in Sirte region, with garbage collection vehicles and equipment to improve the SCC’s ability to collect garbage in Sirte city. During the IS occupation and liberation of Sirte last year, most of the SCC’s vehicles and equipment were looted. This crippled the SCC’s ability to conduct its work. As a result, Sirte currently suffers from a serious garbage accumulation issue in public areas causing the spread of insects, rats and disease and negatively impacting Sirte’s recovery efforts. Improving the SCC’s ability to collect garbage will continue LTI3’s efforts to accelerate early recovery and a return to normalcy in an area a strategic area that was controlled by extremist groups.

While a majority of the displaced have returned to Sirte, the infrastructure and social fabric are in disrepair, making Libya’s center particularly vulnerable and unstable. 
Issue/why: During the IS occupation of Sirte and the following conflict, the Sirte Cleaning Co (SCC), which is a state-owned company, was subject to looting of all large equipment including: garbage vehicles, bulldozers, and garbage containers.. This crippled the SCC’s ability to conduct its trash removal and disposal work. Consequently, Sirte currently suffers from serious garbage accumulation in public areas, causing the spread of insects, rats and disease. Garbage accumulates in several random spots around the city and which severely and negatively impacts the city’s environment and residents’ health. The spread of garbage all around the city shows that life in the city is far from normal, and discourages IDPs from returning and could encourage residents to leave Sirte.
The national government in Libya faces several financial, political and security challenges that prevent it from responding to this dire need. As a government-owned service company, the SCC receives a yearly budget from the national Treasury that covers salaries and fuel, but will not allow for the purchase of heavy equipment, including replacing the looted or destroyed vehicles and garbage containers. Without this equipment, SCC is unable to collect garbage. Supporting the SCC with garbage collection equipment and vehicles will improve its ability to collect garbage in the Sirte region. 
Who/where/With Whom: The SCC is a state-owned company that is responsible for providing the day-to-day cleaning, garbage collection and disposal services in the Sirte. The SCC mandate includes Sirte city and its surrounding suburbs from the borders of Al-Wheska in the west to Herawa in the east. This activity will benefit residents in Sirte city as an immediate priority where the greatest impact can currently be made. LTI3 may provide additional support under future activities that will allow the SCC to cover areas that are under the SCC mandate and located outside Sirte city. Since the liberation of Sirte, the SCC has been providing very limited street cleaning and garbage collection services and is not able to cover all areas under its mandate due to lack of needed equipment such as vehicles and garbage containers.    
How/what: LTI3 will provide garbage trucks, bobcats and garbage containers. After providing it with the required vehicles and equipment, SCC will take full responsibility for managing garbage collection, including both collection and disposal. SCC has their own employees who will be operating the machinery and who are responsible for handling the garbage collection. The SCC will be responsible for paying worker wages and operating costs, such as fuel and other consumables. LTI3 support will improve the SCC ability to collect garbage in Sirte city. Additionally, LTI3 will conduct a media campaign, using videos and billboards, to highlight the SCC efforts in making Sirte a more livable city. Using videos for online and TV distribution and street billboards will ensure the message of the media campaign reach as many residents as possible.

Through this activity, LTI3 is supporting the General Company for Water and Sewage Sirte Service Office (GSWC-SSO) with equipment for wells, including pumps, cables and pipes, to restore their functionality and solve the water shortage issue in Sirte’s undeserved suburbs of Abu Hadi and Gharbiyat. Years of war and IS occupation left Sirte’s water system facilities subject to destruction, looting and neglect, with poor maintenance compounding the problem. As a result, these towns suffer from water shortages. In response, LTI3 will provide in-kind support in the form of water testing, pumps, cables and pipes to address the water shortage issue.

While a majority of the displaced have returned to Sirte, the infrastructure and social fabric are in disrepair, making Libya’s center particularly vulnerable and unstable. Issue: Years of war and IS occupation left Sirte’s water infrastructure and equipment subject to destruction, looting and neglect. Sirte’s under-served suburbs like Abu Hadi, Gharbiyat, Gbiba and Jaref suffer from water shortages and cuts. These towns depend on water collection tanks (water distribution stations) to receive their water supply. The water tanks are connected to the main Al Gardabya tank that receives water from the man-made river as well as a number of wells located in the aforementioned areas. The Ghardaya tank also supplies water to other regions of Sirte. Increased strain on the Gardabya tank, affected water supply in Sirte suburbs.  In addition, poor maintenance for wells’ existing pumps, and illegal water extraction compounded the water shortage problem. To temporarily overcome water shortage, residents are relying on water trucking to fulfill their daily water needs. Residents remain frustrated with the living conditions and with the lack of attention by authorities to address their towns’ water shortage problem.  Who: The General Company for Water and Sewage Sirte Service Office (GSWC-SSO) is a state-owned company that manages the water system and facilities that serves Sirte City and its suburbs. Working with this grantee as the relevant technical authority is key to ensure successful planning and implementation of the activity.Where: LTI conducted a preliminary activity risk assessment of the four areas to determine potential risks and feasibility. Jaref and Gubaiba were classified as extreme risks given elevated risks of thefts and IS presence in these areas. Therefore, LTI3 will use a multi-phased approach to address the water issue by starting with two areas, namely Abu Hadi and Gharbyat. LTI will continue to assess the security situation in Jaref and Gubaiba for a potential ramp up or follow on activity. Abu Hadi and Gharbiyat have a total population of approximately 45,000. These were chosen as target locations because they cover the majority of the affected populations, and they are more readily accessible to LTI. Scarcity of water in these towns is worse than it is in Sirte city and the inability of national and municipal level government institutions to address this basic need combined with lack of attention from the donor community leave residents from these under-served towns frustrated. How: In this activity, LTI3 will provide the GSWC-SSO with in-kind support to test and reactivate water wells that supply water to the Abu Hadi and Gharbiyat water tanks. This support will include procuring and installing pump sets, including accessories such as pipes and cables. The GCWS-SSO will be responsible for operating the pumps and paying the wells’ operational costs (staff wages, cost of power…etc.) after reactivating the wells. The General Electricity Company (GEC) will be responsible for connecting the pumps to the towns’ power supply network in coordination with LTI3’s selected vendor(s). The Sirte Municipal Council (SMC) will help with the logistics and provide security for the activity sites. Supporting the GSWC-SSO with wells’ water pumps, cables and pipes will allow the GSWC-SSO to overcome the water shortage problem permanently. This activity will reduce the frustration and feeling of marginalization among residents of Sirte’s undeserved communities.

This activity seeks to mitigate the risk of theft of equipment and materials at LTI3 activity locations in Sirte. In response to the rise in theft in Sirte, LTI3 will establish a rapid response mechanism to procure and install security upgrades at facilities receiving equipment and materials under LTI3 activities in Sirte region. Over the past few months, several public, private and state-owned facilities have been looted. This has slowed the ongoing recovery efforts, including efforts funded by LTI3, as the program developed appropriate risk mitigation measures. However timely delivery of recovery assistance remains imperative for the program's stabilization objectives. Procurement under this activity will include, Closed Circuit Television Systems (CCTV), alarm systems with integrated GSM alerts, reinforced doors and windows, video intercom systems and security office furniture. This assistance will allow LTI3 to put in place the necessary risk mitigation measures against theft and ensure equipment and materials remain secure, resulting in continued acceleration of  Sirte's recovery.

2. Security upgrades’ equipment and materials at LTI3 activity locations will be a primary deterent to thieves and make looting more difficult. 
3. LTI3 partners have the capacity to respond should looters be caught in action by security equipment, so that the deterrents are credible. 
",Office Security Upgrades for Sirte Activities,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, carjacking, and clashes, and they now speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival rather than democratic transition. The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing angst and instability from crossing a point of no return. 
The Islamic State (IS) emerged in 2015’s governance vacuum, successfully exploiting local grievances and conflicts to consolidate their footprint in the Sirte region, thus establishing their North African base. IS were in full control of central Sirte by early 2016. Sirte became isolated from the rest of Libya, leading to shortages of food, money, and medicine. Oppression, austere living conditions and clashes caused most of central Sirte’s 100,000 residents to flee. After an eight-month campaign reliant on Misratan forces calling itself  Al-Bunyan Al-Marsous (ABAM) and US airpower, the Government of National Accord (GNA) announced Sirte’s liberation in December 2016. While a majority of the displaced have returned to Sirte, the infrastructure and social fabric are in disrepair, making Libya’s center particularly vulnerable and unstable.  
Issue: The IS occupation, along with intensive urban warfare to liberate the city created a security vacuum currently being exploited by several armed actors and criminal gangs. While security forces in the Sirte region continue to prevent and deter mass-IS encroachment on the city of Sirte, ABAM inter-factional fissures have been emerging as a result of several loose affiliations within the boundaries of the city, most notably between Misratan militias and the Salafi 604 Brigade. Criminal groups are already identifying, and capitalizing, on these fissures. This is demonstrated by a spike in regional crime in recent months, with theft of equipment from public and private facilities on the rise. Public facilities with equipment required to provide public services have not been exempt from looting. Electrical cables, IT equipment, water pumps, generators are among highly sought-after items.Current trends indicate this will continue which will affect the ongoing recovery efforts in Sirte including those funded by LTI3, in Sirte. 
Why: LTI3 seeks to mitigate the risk of theft and ensure that all activities that are being implemented in Sirte, are achieving their intended objectives of accelerating the recovery efforts and return to normalcy in Sirte, which remains a priority in spite of the security situation. In addition, LTI's wider portfolio of stabilization and recovery efforts in Sirte contributes toward styming the governance vacuum that can be exploited by armed actors and gangs. 
How/What: Through this Direct Distribution of Goods and Services (DDGS) activity, LTI3 will establish a rapid procurement mechanism to procure and install security upgrades at facilities receiving equipment and materials under LTI3 activities in Sirte region. Procurement under this activity will include Closed Circuit Television Systems (CCTV), alarm systems with integrated GSM alerts, reinforced doors and windows, video intercom systems and security office furniture. This assistance will allow LTI3's timely placement of necessary risk mitigation measures against theft, ensuring equipment and materials remain secure, resulting in continued acceleration of Sirte's recovery.

Through this activity, LTI3 is supporting the General Company for Water and Sewage Sirte Service Office (GSWC-SSO) with spare parts for sewage pumps and sewage vacuum trucks to provide immediate relief to the broken Sirte sewage system while medium-term fixes (CTR011) are in progress. Years of war and IS occupation left Sirte’s sewage system facilities and equipment subject to destruction, looting and neglect, with poor maintenance compounding the problem. The current sewage overflow in residential areas risks spread of insects and diseases, contamination of aquafer water, and continued displacement of residents. Under this activity, LTI3 will provide the GCWS-SSO with spare parts to reactivate pumps at a sewage pumping station and 3 sewage vacuum truck servicing the whole city. This support will allow the GCWS-SSO to partially manage the sewage crisis in the immediate term until mid-term solutions under CTR011 take effects. Through LTI3 support, Residents of Sirte city will acknowledge that some efforts are being made to solve the sewage crisis. This will contribute to LTI3’s efforts to accelerate recovery in Sirte city.
","
IF: The GCWS-SSO reactivates pumps at 3 sewage pumping stations and provides 3 sewage vacuum trucks

THEN: Residents in 11 neighborhoods of Sirte city will acknowledge that some efforts are being made to solve the sewage crisis.

BECAUSE: 

-Operating the targeted pumps and vacuum trucks is enough to reduce the severity of the sewage overflow during the current winter season.



-Intervention will occur in time to make a meaningful difference.



",Rapid Support for Sirte Sewage System,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, carjacking, and clashes, and they now speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival rather than democratic transition. The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing angst and instability from crossing a point of no return. The Islamic State (IS) emerged in 2015’s governance vacuum, successfully exploiting local grievances and conflicts to consolidate their footprint in the Sirte region, thus establishing their North African base. IS were in full control of central Sirte by early 2016. Sirte became isolated from the rest of Libya, leading to shortages of food, money, and medicine. Oppression, austere living conditions and clashes caused most of central Sirte’s 100,000 residents to flee. After an eight-month campaign reliant on Misratan forces and US airpower, the Government of National Accord (GNA) announced Sirte’s liberation in December 2016. While a majority of the displaced have returned to Sirte, the infrastructure and social fabric are in disrepair, making Libya’s center particularly vulnerable and unstable. Issue: Years of war and IS occupation left Sirte’s sewage infrastructure and equipment subject to destruction, looting and neglect. Poor maintenance and absence of spare parts compounded the problem. Consequently, Sirte suffers from overflow in residential areas, spread of insects and diseases, contamination of aquafer water. In the immediate areas, residents remain displaced or frustrated with the living conditions. CTR011 will reactivate 7 of the pumps, restoring basic functionality to the system. However, CTR011 requires specialty equipment that will not be available for 4 months. Residents will remain frustrated with the slow pace of progress, unless urgent and visible changes on the ground are made to the city’s standing sewage pools.  Who: The General Company for Water and Sewage Sirte Service Office (GSWC-SSO) is as state-owned company that manages the sewage system and facilities that serves Sirte City and its suburbs. Working with this grantee as the relevant technical authority is key to ensure successful planning and implementation of the activity.Where/Why: Supporting the GSWC-SSO with spare parts to reactivate their out-of-service vacuum trucks and 3 existing pumps at one of Sirte sewage stations (PS 3) is an intermediate measure during the rainy season that will allow the GSWC-SSO to reduce the severity of the sewage overflow during the current winter season. Under this proposed activity, LTI3 will help the GCWS-SSO to partially manage the sewage crisis affecting the entire city of Site (all 11 neighborhoods) in the immediate term until CTR011 equipment is delivered and installed in Sirte, which will reduce the frustration of Sirte city residents from the slow recovery of the sewage system. This will accelerate recovery in Sirte. How: In this activity, LTI3 will provide the GSWC-SSO with in-kind support to procure and deliver spare parts to reactivate three vacuum trucks and 3 existing pumps at Sirte’s Pumping Station 3 (PS 3). LTI3 support under this activity constitutes rapid support to increase the capacity at PS 3 from 15% to 60% and to bring 3 vacuum trucks back to service. Additionally, bringing the 3 vacuum trucks back to service will allow the GSWC-SSO to clean the clogged parts of the sewage system across all 11 neighborhoods in Sirte city.

","Focused Analysis, Innovation, Research, & Mapping to Inform and Support Libya","
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.

Progress on the political transition is inseparable from security trends. Chronic instability makes it difficult to implement key transition milestones, undermines the credibility of the government, empowers extremists, and has a chilling effect on civic engagement. Continued stagnation in the political process also compounds grievances, damages confidence in the transition, and creates space for spoilers to fuel additional conflict. Expanding extremist influence, continued assassinations in Benghazi, pervasive lawlessness and porous borders in the South, and escalating tensions in Tripoli are all clear indications that bolstering security is an increasing priority for the success of the transition and the stability of the country. 

In response to these trends, LTI is rapidly expanding. Contextual analysis is critical to ensure that LTI’s strategy and programs are calibrated to current dynamics and engaging important actors in critical areas. In order to promote evidence-based and analysis-driven programming, this activity will support the production of research products to help LTI shape strategy, design activities, and evaluate impact of activities during the expansion. Over a six month period, this activity will produce:

- Requests for Information (RFIs): these short, focused reports will be frontloaded during the activity period in order to provide a rapid infusion of tactical research that will help LTI better focus programming during the crucial initial months of the expansion. The focus will primarily be on quickly developing more detailed information in areas where LTI plans on clustering community improvement activities – e.g. neighborhood dynamics, profiles of political leaders or other key actors, current security deployments, etc. LTI staff will work closely with Navanti analysts to continually design these RFIs over the course of the activity so they provide timely research on evolving trends and emerging program development priorities.

- Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) assessments: these assessments will provide more extended and detailed analysis of extremism trends in key geographic areas such as Benghazi, Derna, Tripoli, and the Southwest region.

- Mapping/Monitoring Moderate Voices (M3V) reports: these detailed works will identify and evaluate the virtual (i.e. social media) portals to extremism, as well as moderate voices found on websites and social media. The reports map the physical locations and characteristics for key at-risk/vulnerable populations for recruitment and radicalization, and identify potential indigenous counters or programming choices to violent extremism and encouraging moderate voices. This type of cutting edge social media network analysis is important in Libya, where Facebook and Twitter are major sources of information and influence, and where most extremist groups and moderate voices have a very active presence online. 

Navanti is an innovative supplier of services spanning research, social media programming, activity design, implementation, and advanced analysis to a diverse range of United States Government (USG) customers. Navanti specifically focus on delivering analytical products into developing, conflict affected, and transitioning economies and on issues spanning asymmetric warfare, countering violent extremist organizations (CVEO) communications, economics, governance, political transition, conflict mitigation and national security. Navanti recently developed CVE assessments for the OTI program in Tunisia, and has been producing research products on Libya, Mali, and Sahel-wide dynamics for various USG clients. Navanti has a network of field researchers throughout Libya who are supported by a team of analysts in their DC-area home office. Given the volatile, sensitive, and occasionally non-permissive environment in LTI’s geographic areas of concentration, Navanti is uniquely situated to fill critical research and analysis gaps. 

This activity assumes that enhanced, granular analysis will enable LTI to develop more focused and effective grants to bolster security and boost community development in support of a stable transition.

EST002,Qaminis Municipal Council,Completed,2017-08-25,2017-11-12,189151.97,189270.3,"
This activity seeks to enable the Qaminis Municipal Council to effectively respond to citizen demands for improving road safety and traffic congestion at the ""T"" junction that runs through the middle of Qaminis. The target community of Qaminis/Magroon has a democratically elected council and is located 50 km south of Benghazi. To achieve this objective, LTI 3 will help Qaminis MC to repair the lighting system, signage and curb stones of the main highway that travels through the city. Qaminis' infrastructure, including this highway (road), suffered significant damages during clashes between LNA and Benghazi Defense Brigade in 2016. Despite lack of funding, Qaminis Municipal Council made an effort to improve the road by repairing potholes and installing a new layer of asphalt, however the highway needs some additional work to become safe and reduce congestion. LTI3 will provide lighting (fixed posts and bulbs), curb paint, warning and town signs to support to completion the MC's road rehabilitation effort. In addition, this activity will support the MC to conduct a public outreach and awareness campaign, and hold an opening ceremony on the highway, which will engage tribal leaders of Qaminis and Magroon areas to highlight the Municipal Council's responsiveness to community demands.
","
IF the Qaminis Municipal Council repairs the major highway intersection in the center of town, THEN it will demonstrate its ability to respond to the priorities of residents of Qaminis and surrounding areas, BECAUSE:





1. We assume that improving this stretch of road is a visible and priority community need


2. We assume citizens want to see the Municipal Council, as opposed to some other actor, addressing critical priorities; 


3. We assume choice of partners and communications campaign will be sufficient measures to prevent military actors from claiming credit for this activity.











 
",Qaminis Highway,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Fragile and poorly maintained infrastructure causes major services disruptions, which, in what used to be an upper middle income country, contributes to widespread anger and perceptions of marginalization. Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, car jacking, and clashes. Discussion of democratic transition is now limited mostly to elites, while average citizens speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival. The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing unrest, angst and instability from crossing a point of no return. 
Eastern Libya is the primary seat of power for Khalifa Haftar, the Libyan National Army (LNA), the House of Representatives (HoR), and the parallel Thinni-led government. Though Haftar enjoys high approval ratings and the LNA has dramatically improved security in the areas it controls, increasingly dictatorial tendencies and the militarization of elected municipal councils do not bode well for Libya’s long term stability. Over the past year, the LNA’s military governor for northern Cyrenaica, Abdul Razzaq Nazuri, has replaced mayors from elected municipal councils across eastern Libya with appointed mayors, who are often current or former military officers.
Nazuri has justified the appointments by pointing to public dissatisfaction with the municipal councils’ poor performance. Fractures within the LNA are increasingly likely, particularly due to growing tension between secular and Salafist elements under Heftar’s leadership.
To counter this trend in the great Benghazi region, LTI 3 is supporting efforts of some the remaining representative institutions to effectively respond to citizen priorities. Qaminis is located about 50 km South of Benghazi. The municipal council was elected in the summer of 2014, with 6 male and 1 female member. Qaminis Municipal Council is currently running services for Qaminis and other districts surrounding the town, including Magroon. Because of the clashes between the LNA and Benghazi Defense Brigade (BDB) in 2016 between Benghazi and Ajdabia, the area's infrastructure has been damaged, especially in the Magroon district.
Issue: The main highway connecting Magroon, Qaminis and Soloq has been significantly damaged from the recent fighting, with large potholes, broken lighting and damaged warning signs contributing many accidents and traffic along this high-use stretch of road. The highway connection is a 1.5 km stretch of road within Qaminis in a (T) shape, connecting Magroon to the South, Soloq to the East, and Benghazi to the North. This part of the highway system is a very important route for the cities in the area (Qaminis, Magroon, and Soloq), because it connects these areas to the larger urban centers of Ajdabia and Benghazi. Citizens of Qaminis are weary from the fighting and are growing increasingly frustrated with the road/traffic problem. The council has been proactive contacting authorities (Al-Thinni) and requesting resources to repair the highway, but unfortunately no support has materialized.
Why: In response to this challenge and demand from its residents, the Qaminis MC mobilized some community resources to fix some of the potholes with asphalt, however these resources were not sufficient to fix the broken lightning, damaged signs, or paint the curbstones along the highway. By supporting the Qaminis MC to complete this important section of the road, they will be able to effectively respond to citizen's demands, and reinforce the support from the community. Municipalities' responsiveness to priority issues would fend off reasons for the public to be dissatisfied with their elected representatives, and therefore lessen the risk of the MC being supplanted by a militarized council.
Who/Where: Qaminis Municipality in coordination with the local branch of the electricity and lighting utility. Engagement of the elected municipal council will reinforce the abilities of civilian led governance bodies. Engagement of of the electricity and lighting utility will ensure involvement of non-military aligned actors. The town of Qaminis is strategic because it is one of the 3 remaining MC's in Greater Benghazi that has not yet been militarized. Ongoing efforts to militarize of Qaminis have been unsuccessful to date, so LTI is in a unique position to reinforce vulnerable civilian authorities at this pivotal point in time. 
How/What: LTI3 will support the Qaminis MC to repair and install safety signs, lighting, and painting curb stones. The Qaminis MC will also lead a public outreach campaign to raise awareness among Qaminis residents to highlight the MC's efforts to improve safety on the road. The Qaminis MC will hold an opening ceremony for the project, once it is completed, to publicize its efforts to address community needs.

EST003,Al Bayda Municipal Council,Completed,2017-07-30,2017-12-17,208953.14,197260.77,"
The activity seeks to increase awareness among citizens of Bayda of the Municipal Council's ability to deliver basic services. To achieve this objective, LTI3 will help Bayda MC install traffic lights in the new roads and streets that Bayda MC recently repaired. Citizens have identified adequate road maintenance and traffic safety as key service delivery priorities. LTI3 will support Bayda MC to continue its efforts to improve road maintenance and traffic safety inside the city. Through this activity Bayda MC will work on making traffic on the roads much safer for the community. In addition, the MC in coordination with Traffic Police will conduct a public outreach (awareness) campaign to educate people about rules and responsibilities of traffic laws, and also to highlight the MC's service delivery efforts. MC will hold an opening ceremonies in one of the main traffic centers in Bayda city. Bayda MC will lead the campaign since it is responsible for direct implementation of service delivery at the local level, with technical assistance from the Bayda Traffic Police.  



","
If the Bayda MC installs traffic lights at 10 intersections and pedestrian crosswalks in Bayda, THEN citizen awareness of the MC's ability to address community needs will increase, BECAUSE:
- Citizens have identified road maintenance and traffic safety as a service delivery priority that they want local authorities to address.
--The MC wants to meet community needs but lacks adequate funds.
- The project's outreach component will inform citizens of the MC's activity and will also highlight participation of the Traffic Police.
- The traffic light system is a highly visible project that many residents will notice and appreciate.


",Bayda Traffic Lights System,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Fragile and poorly maintained infrastructure causes major services disruptions, which, in what used to be an upper middle income country, contributes to widespread anger and perceptions of marginalization.  Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, car jacking, and clashes.  Discussion of democratic transition is now limited mostly to elites, while average citizens speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival.  The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse.

 Eastern Libya is the primary seat of power for Khalifa Haftar, the Libyan National Army (LNA), the House of Representatives (HoR), and the parallel Thinni-led government.  Though Haftar enjoys high approval ratings and the LNA has dramatically improved security in the areas it controls, increasingly dictatorial tendencies and the militarization of elected municipal councils do not bode well for Libya’s long term stability.  Over the past year, the LNA’s military governor for northern Cyrenaica, Abdul Razzaq Nazuri, has replaced mayors from elected municipal councils across eastern Libya with appointed mayors, who are often current or former military officers. 
Nazuri has justified the appointments by pointing to public dissatisfaction with the municipal councils’ poor performance.  Fractures within the LNA are increasingly likely, particularly due to growing tension between secular and Salafist elements under Haftar’s leadership.


Issue: Bayda city in eastern Libya suffers from poor service delivery and deteriorating infrastructure.  Since the 2011 revolution, the quality of the city’s main of highways and roads has declined due to a lack of maintenance and repair. In response to community complaints, Bayda Municipal Council (MC) took out small loans to repair potholes. However, the Bayda MC lacks funds to fix existing traffic lights and install additional traffic lights to better organize traffic and further reduce the risk of traffic accidents, especially involving school children who cross the roads on a daily basis.  The parallel Thinni Government is preventing eastern banks from providing additional loans to the Bayda MC, which would allow them to install traffic lights.  Local citizens interpret the interference as aiming to hinder the work of the Bayda MC and pave the way for an appointed military council takeover.  It is also noteworthy, that Nazuri, the military governor, highlighted the Bayda MC's work as an example of good service delivery to military mayors in the region.

 Why: The U.N.-led Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) singed in December 2015 sought to safeguard a democratic transition in Libya by empowering the interim Government of National Accord (GNA) to mend Libya's political divisions and advance its recovery from the impacts of violent conflict until elections can be held.  Despite strong support from the international community, powerful spoilers, especially Haftar and the LNA,continue to challenge the GNA's authority. Moreover, surveys conducted by LTI suggest a growing disdain for national-level governance across Libya as the GNA struggles to address the country's security, economic and governance challenges. In this context, supporting democratically elected municipal councils has taken on greater significance in efforts to provide tangible gains to an increasingly agitated populace while preserving credibility of the country’s last democratically elected governance structures. Local-level government is the layer of government closest to the people. Therefore, LTI3 assumes that future democratic development in Libya will be heavily informed by Libyans’ initial experience with elected representatives, particularly those with whom they interact with directly. A recent survey conducted by LTI reveals that Libya's municipal councils, elected in 2013/2014 to four-year terms, are regarded as the country's most credible governance institutions. To help maintain this momentum, LTI seeks to provide targeted support to elected municipal councils to fulfill their role in meeting citizen need and supporting stability in the daily lives of Libyans through the establishment and management of public services. Support for elected and moderate actors may also reduce the space for extremists groups that seek to exert influence over vulnerable communities by exploiting governance gaps and perceptions of marginalization. Bayda is a critical city in Libya because it is one of the few remaining urban centers in the east with a functioning, democratically elected municipal council that is not run by an appointed military mayor. The Bayda MC, however, is struggling to provide public services due to the lack of resources from the national government. The MC also asked for help from the parallel Thinni government, which is allied with Haftar and rivals the GNA, to address deteriorating infrastructure and basic services, but did not receive support.

Who/Where: Al Bayda Municipal Council located in eastern Libya.

 



How/What: The activity aims to help the Bayda MC—an inclusive, representative governance institution—to effectively respond to community priorities. LTI3 will support the Bayda MC with the repair and installation of traffic lights in key areas throughout the city to improve road safety, which the community has identified as a key service delivery priority. Additionally, the LTI3 will support the Bayda MC and the traffic authority with a public outreach campaign to raise awareness among Al Bayda residents about traffic safety and laws and to highlight the Bayda MC's service delivery efforts.  The Bayda MC will lead the activity and will receive technical assistance from the Bayda Traffic Authority. The Bayda MC will hold an opening ceremony for the project in one of the main traffic centers in Bayda to publicize its efforts to address community needs.

EST004,Shahat Municipal Council,Completed,2017-07-06,2017-09-03,119340.15,124137.91,"
The activity seeks to increase awareness among students, parents, and families in the Shahat MC’s jurisdiction (Shahat, Susa, Gernada and Faydia) of Shahat Municipal Council's ability to deliver critical basic services. To achieve this objective, LTI-3 will support Shahat MC to refurbish 17 schools , which fall under Shahat MC jurisdiction. Due to lack of funding Shahat area suffered a lot in terms of infrastructure, school buildings have been decaying with no inspection nor proper maintenance to the damaged ones. LTI is helping the council to overcome this problem through grant (BEN027) to help the council rehabilitate the most damaged restrooms in some schools which are located also in Sh'hat and surrounding areas. Under this activity, LTI3 is continuing this support to the council by providing furniture (desks) to other schools listed in this activity, which will affect positively school enrollment and attendance rates. 
In addition, the MC will conduct a public outreach and awareness campaign and hold 3 opening ceremonies in 3 selected schools to highlight the MC's service delivery efforts. Throughout eastern Libya the LNA has been replacing elected councils with militarized ones. This activity will contribute to overall confidence in the participatory basic service delivery process led by the democratically-elected municipal council.
","
If the Shahat MC is seen to be transparently and collaboratively supporting critical service delivery in the education sector, then citizens will have increased confidence in the MC’s ability to govern, because:
 - Education is a high-priority need for students and families in Shahat and the condition of schools is a key concern that citizens have raised through the assessment of international organizations and community of Shahat (assessment from our previous grants that are similar, BEN028 ""Equipping Bayda School"" was highly visible)

 - Citizens currently lack information about MC efforts to address critical public needs and therefore do not have confidence in their ability to govern.
 - Citizens value transparency and want to see their elected officials conducting business in a fair and transparent manner.





",Refurbishing Sha'hat Schools,"
Since the signing of the Libya Political Agreement (LPA) in late 2015, Libya’s political future is hopeful but fragile. A new Government of National Accord (GNA) is working to help the country recover from two years of violent conflict between regional political factions. Despite strong support from the international community, powerful spoilers – particularly in the East – continue to challenge the GNA.  Entrenched disdain for national level governance and rapidly eroding quality of life undermines the GNA’s credibility. Meanwhile, municipal councils have assumed significant governance and service delivery responsibilities over the past 2 years, and they are still viewed as the most credible institutions. However, they face serious challenges in providing services to their constituents and are disconnected from national level counterparts and other local actors. Finally, the fragmentation of Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism, with the Islamic State and other extremist organizations taking advantage of governance and security dysfunction to strengthen their influence.
At the local level, municipal councils have tried to fill the governance vacuum since 2014, and they remain Libya's most legitimate and functional democratic bodies. According to recent LTI sponsored research, 55% of Libyans view municipal councils as legitimate. Yet, that legitimacy is eroding, as most MCs lack the resources to provide basic services and are detached from national institutions, other local governance actors, and constituents. In response, LTI 3 is supporting MCs and their partners to bolster two critical pillars of effective local governance – basic service delivery and public outreach and communications. According to LTI research, these are the two factors most correlated with public confidence in local governance in Libya. As part of these activities, LTI-3 program is facilitating relationships between national ministries and local governance stakeholders to strengthen the long-term institutional channels for the flow of resources and technical capacity to the local level. In addition, under the awareness campaign, LTI-3 is helping MCs build a collaborative, participatory approach to governance and service delivery involving civil society, tribal leaders, neighborhood councils, national representatives, and constituents. Where MC leadership is unsettled, LTI-3 is working more closely with community level actors to strengthen participatory governance and basic services. This includes CSOs, neighborhood councils, and ministry representatives, where possible.
Throughout Eastern Libya, which is largely controlled by Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA), the LNA has forcibly replaced the mayors in many municipal councils with current or former military officers, thereby undermining the country’s last democratically elected bodies whose mandates haven’t expired. Undermining the councils helps Haftar, who opposes the GNA, consolidate power and continue to challenge efforts to reach a national political compromise. Particularly in Benghazi, the military mayor is aggressively publicizing basic service delivery efforts and taking credit for service delivery interventions implemented by others, including the UNDP Stabilization Facility. This tactic has increased the military mayors’ popularity, often at the expense of the few remaining democratically elected mayors left in the east. In some cases, citizens have asked the LNA to replace their elected mayors based on their belief that a military mayor will more effectively address their service delivery needs.
To counter this trend in the greater Benghazi region, LTI 3 is supporting participatory service delivery efforts in the remaining democratically-elected civilian municipal councils in towns distributed around militarized ones, including Shahat. While the elected council of Shahat is prioritizing basic service delivery to the area of Shahat and its surroundings (Sousa, Faidia, and Gernada), it faces a severe lack of funding that has prevented it from effectively meeting the needs of its constituents. In particular, the council needs additional support to improve quality of education, as this sector has been hard hit by the country’s instability. Schools do not have adequate supplies for the number of students they are supposed to serve, with students often sitting 3-4 at a desk and school buildings in varying states of decay. These conditions present physical and psychological challenges to both students and teachers and make it difficult for them to perform well. Additionally, the number of students in primary, elementary, and high schools in Gernanda, Al Faidya, Susua and Shahat City Center has been dropping because of these poor conditions. The Shahat MC went so far as to describe the previous school year as a disaster, after receiving complaints from parents that students were forced to travel long distances to find schools in other districts that had space for them. The MC has received many urgent requests from school principals, parents, and students asking them to intervene and improve the situation in schools, furthermore the council recognizes the effort LTI put in equipping Bayda schools with desks (BEN028) as they confirmed the positive perception from the community of Bayda and Shahat to this grant. The MC is seeking to increase confidence from the community and implement a project that would have the same impact. 
In this activity, LTI-3 will support the Shahat MC and local education office to complete the refurbishment of the 17 public schools in Shahat, Gernanda, Al Faidya and Susua. LTI-3 will provide 400 double school desks, and a set of equipment (electronics copy machines and PC desktops) for administration use, The MC and local education office will develop a draft prioritization list for distribution to the 17 schools based on their location, needs and size of each school. The schools will be consulted in the development of this list and the MC will confirm that all are in consensus with the final list, to prevent any perception of favoritism or conflict among schools who receive different levels of support. In addition, LTI 3 will work with the Municipal Council to conduct 3 opening ceremonies in selected schools by MC in Shahat area. The Municipal Council will invite the media to highlight the refurbishment of the schools, and the event will be open to the community to increase awareness of the municipal council's efforts. LTI 3 will also support the distribution of printed materials to students and their parents under ""Our Shared Responsibility"" to highlight the MC and ""Local Education Office"" efforts. Highlighting the municipal council's key role in addressing this problem will strengthen the relationship between them and the community and will increase awareness of the council's efforts to address critical service delivery issues. Especially in the East, it is critical that LTI 3 strengthen public confidence in democratically-elected MCs to stand against the trend of the military taking over municipal councils.

EST005,The Libyan Red Crescent – Benghazi “LRC”,Cleared,2017-10-04,2018-03-15,425141.51,380585.26,"
This activity seeks to improve perceptions of recovery among Garyunis residents and encourage IDPs who fled the area to return. Located at the western entrance of Benghazi, Garyunis was under extremist control during the three year war between extremist factions and the LNA, and suffered from major destruction. Thousands of residents were forced to flee to other parts of Benghazi and cities across Libya. The LNA liberated Garyunis from extremist control in June 2016, but the neighborhood remains heavily damaged and public services have not been restored. LTI will partner with the Libyan Red Crescent (LRC) to implement a cleanup campaign to remove visible scars of the recent war by removing garbage and burnt vehicles; painting damaged curbs and a prominent wall covered with extremist graffiti at the University of Benghazi; and repairing traffic lights. LRC will engage community members to participate in the campaign and play an active role in the recovery. This provision of assistance will accelerate the early recovery and return to normalcy in one of LTI's strategic areas.

If the Benghazi LRC implements a clean-up campaign and targeted rehabilitation and beautification interventions in Garyunis, then perceptions among Garyunis residents of recovery efforts in the area will improve, and Garyunis IDPs will be more likely to return to the area because:
1. War damage in public spaces and the accumulation of garbage and debris in Garyunis are visible reminders of conflict that prevent residents from feeling fully recovered, and deter IDPs from returning.  
2. Members of Garyunis community will participate through the activity and will work as volunteers, because they are motivated to support recovery efforts and want to return.
3. Engaging community members in the clean up efforts will amplify the intended message of 'return to normalcy' because members of the community who will engage in the cleanup campaign will likely communicate positive developments to family members and friends who have still not returned.
",Garyunis Clean-up Campaign,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Fragile and poorly maintained infrastructure causes major services disruptions, which, in what used to be an upper middle income country, contributes to widespread anger and perceptions of marginalization.  Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, car jacking, and clashes. Discussion of democratic transition is now limited mostly to elites, while average citizens speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival. The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing unrest, angst and instability from crossing a point of no return. 
Eastern Libya is the primary seat of power for Khalifa Haftar, the Libyan National Army (LNA), the House of Representatives (HoR), and the parallel Thinni-led government. Though Haftar enjoys high approval ratings and the LNA has dramatically improved security in the areas it controls, increasingly dictatorial tendencies and the militarization of elected municipal councils do not bode well for Libya’s long term stability. Over the past year, the LNA’s military governor for northern Cyrenaica, Abdul Razzaq Nazuri, has replaced mayors from elected municipal councils across eastern Libya with appointed mayors, who are often current or former military officers. Nazuri has justified the appointments by pointing to public dissatisfaction with the municipal councils’ poor performance. Fractures within the LNA are increasingly likely, particularly due to growing tension between secular and Salafist elements under Haftar’s leadership.
Issue: Garyunis is located at the west entrance of the city of Benghazi and is 16 km away from the central ,SouqAl-Hout district. Garyunis consists of approximately 7,000 residential units, two centrally located mosques, a police station, a clinic, and four schools. The area  was under control of the Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council (BRSC), a violent extremist group, during three years of intense fighting between extremists and the LNA.  Thousands of residents were forced to flee the violence and relocate to other parts of Benghazi and other cities across Libya.
Why: The LNA liberated Garyunis from the BRSC in July 2016. However, public services and infrastructure were severely damaged by the three year conflict. The area's streets are piled high with rubble, and destruction from years of armed clashes mar local homes and buildings. Neither the previous municipal council, nor the current militarized one, have provided any support for recovery, which has increased community frustration and prevented internally displaced people from returning. In the face of undeniable neglect, community members organized themselves in a local council that succeeded in pressuring several public institutions to address basic recovery needs. These interventions were limited in scope due to the lack of financial resources, and returns to the area remain limited.  
Who/Where: Building on this community-based momentum, the Libyan Red Crescent (LRC) seeks to improve perceptions about recovery among Garyunis residents and facilitate the return of IDPs by removing the visible scars of the war. LRC has broad community acceptance throughout Benghazi and across the country. Under previous OTI-funded activities, LRC succeeded in mobilizing community volunteers and has provided access to challenging environments. 
How/What: LTI 3 will provide basic materials and support for a community cleanup, and beautification campaign organized by LRC. The grantee will launch an outreach campaign aimed at mobilizing Garyunis residents to participate in the cleanup campaign and highlight recovery efforts. In parallel with the cleanup, OTI will support LRC to repair traffic light systems in the area and paint sidewalk curbs as well as the main wall of the university of Benghazi, an important landmark that extremists had occupied during the past conflict. This high-visibility assistance will accelerate early recovery and return to normalcy in one of OTI's strategic locations and will act as a catalyst for IDPs to return to this and neighboring areas.

The activity seeks to create a platform and relationship with Benghazi local stakeholders to facilitate access in the future by rehabilitating one of Benghazi damaged kindergartens which is located in Gharyunis. Gharyunis is located at the west entrance of the city of Benghazi. The area was under control of the Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council (BRSC), a violent extremist group, during three years of intense fighting between extremists and the LNA. Thousands of residents were forced to flee the violence and relocate to other parts of Benghazi and other cities across Libya and did not return even after the LNA liberated the city. The Garyunis kindergarten used to host more than 250 children before the conflict is currently closed. LTI3 will partner with the Libyan Association for Supporting Towns and Municipalities (LASTM) to rehabilitate the kindergarten and in doing so encouraging IDPs to return to their neighborhood. LTI3 will also support LASTM to implement an outreach campaign in Benghazi city with more concentration on areas that have have IDPs to increase visibility and will also support planting campaign for 3 days in the kindergarten to increase community engagement, especially children parents with each other and with LASTM.


","
IF LTI3 works with the Libyan Association for Supporting Towns and Municipalities (LASTM) in coordination with the Benghazi Project Office to restore the Garyunis kindergarten,
THEN LTI3 will build better relations with key local stakeholders to facilitate access and future programming in Benghazi, 
BECAUSE:
1.The BPO prioritizes the revival of civil society in Benghazi and will therefore not resist LTI3's shift to partnering with CSOs rather than the BPO.  
2. Further exposure to local CSOs and communities previously controlled by extremist groups will yield more contextual information needed to identify programming opportunities under PO3.

Eastern Libya is the primary seat of power for Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA), the House of Representatives (HoR), and the parallel Thinni-led government. Haftar enjoys relatively high approval ratings, and the LNA has dramatically improved security in the areas it controls, but fractures within the LNA are increasingly likely, particularly due to growing tension between secular and Salafist elements under Haftar’s leadership. The region also faces increasing dictatorial tendencies and militarization of elected municipal councils. To date, LTI3 has observed that councils with higher public satisfaction levels have greater immunity against the trend of militarization.  Garyunis is located at the west entrance of the city of Benghazi and is 16 km away from the central Souq Al-Hout district. Garyunis consists of approximately 7,000 residential units, two centrally located mosques, a police station, a clinic, and four schools. The area was under control of the Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council (BRSC), a violent extremist group, during three years of intense fighting between extremists and the LNA.  Thousands of residents were forced to flee the violence and relocate to other parts of Benghazi and other cities across Libya.
The LNA liberated Garyunis from the BRSC in July 2016. However, public services and infrastructure were severely damaged by the three-year conflict. Neither the previous municipal council, nor the current militarized one, have provided sufficient support for recovery. In the face of undeniable neglect, frustrated community members organized themselves in a local committee that succeeded in pressuring several public institutions to address basic recovery needs. These interventions were limited in scope due to the lack of financial resources, and returns to the area remain limited. The Benghazi Project Office (BPO) echoed Garyounis recovery needs in a meeting with USAID/OTI. While LTI has concerns about the attributions risks posed by working with the Benghazi Municipal Council (BMC), or its technical sub-offices, LTI sees areas for cooperation with the BMC or BPO in other program areas, such as countering violent extremism, where interests are shared and attribution concerns are non-existent. In order to gain access to and learn more about key areas, relationships, and populations for CVE programming in Benghazi, LTI is investing in some small recovery activities that pose relatively low attribution risks for the program's ""governance"" objective (also see EST010). The Garyunis kindergarten is located a few kilometers away from a camp where IDPs from Tawergha reside and once hosted 250 children. The building sustained infrastructure damage as a result of the recent conflict. It is currently closed, but the school principal and parents have been actively seeking to reopen it, but lack of resources. 
LTI selected the organization LASTM, who’s favored by the project office and have good accessibility to the targeted site with no security concerns while LTI tests the BPO through another activity that is under development (EST010) and evaluates response. The Libyan Association for Supporting Towns and Municipalities (LASTM) is composed of former mayors and municipal members who have served under previous municipalities that received funding from OTI. Under previous OTI-funded activity (BEN032,033 and 034), LASTM succeeded in implementing various service delivery projects that responded to pressing needs in various neighborhoods of Benghazi. 
With support from USAID/OTI, LASTM will rehabilitate the Garyunis kindergarten. LASTM will coordinate with the kindergarten principal, local council and neighborhood activists to conduct an outreach campaign that will target various community groups including parents of children who were registered in the kindergarten as well as Tawergha displaced community who live in the proximity of the kindergarten.

This activity seeks to promote the Shahat MC as model ofmoderate, elected governance via its support to the local LRC branch to provide critical services to Derna's displaced people. As the Libyan National Army (LNA) tightens its grip on the city, over 300 families have fled to nearby towns including Shahat, Faydia, and Gernada given their relative stability. As fears of an upcoming LNA campaign on intervention are looming, the Shahat MC and the Libyan Red Crescent - Shahat and Derna Branches (LRC) are preparing to respond to an anticipated influx of IDPs, as well as providing relief services to people who have already relocated. LTI3 will support LRC [and??] to provide relief to Derna's displaced community. These will include first aid kits, mattresses, blankets, NFIs, stretchers, and tents. Shahat MC will also implement an outreach campaign to promote the role of a moderate and inclusive community in responding to their neighbors in crisis. This activity will contribute to LTI efforts to reinforce moderate values.
","
IF Sha'hat MC enhances the LRC Shahat branch’s readiness to provide swift emergency relief services to incoming IDPs from Derna then, moderate values in Derna will be encouraged because:
- IDPs who flee Derna are not involved in the DMSC or other extremist groups, otherwise they would be staying in Derna to fight or otherwise support DMSC efforts against the LNA.
- Relevant, timely services coupled with targeted outreach efforts by the MC, will send a powerful message to Derna IDPs about the benefits they can gain from an inclusive, participatory governance body.
- Outreach by the MC will take into account regional and cultural sensitivities to prevent a negative backlash from IDPs.
Supplies will be sufficient for the yet-unknown caseload, so that the response is seen as readied and responsive, rather than lacking.

To date, LTI3 has observed that councils with higher public satisfaction levels have greater immunity against the trend of militarization. 
Located about 300 km from Benghazi along the coast, Derna suffered from marginalization by the Qaddafi regime and has had a long history foreign jihad. Thus Derna, became a critical base for the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), formed in 1995 with aspirations to overthrow the Qaddafi regime. Post-revolution, a number of indigenous extremist militias had taken root in Derna. Several joined forces to form the Derna Mujahideen Shura Council (DMSC), as a coalition against General Heftar, who had launched Operation Dignity against Islamist militias. When IS later attempted to establish a foothold in Derna, it was the homegrown DMSC that expelled them in 2015. While not a formal governing force, DMSC exercises a large amount of control over the city. As such, the LNA has namely contained this hotbed of extremism, keeping a buffer between Derna and territories it controls.
Having completed military operations in Benghazi, the LNA tightened its siege on Derna in August 2017. Residents are facing critical shortages in food supplies, cash and medicine, prompting a new wave of IDPs. Most recently, more than 300 families have fled to nearby towns including Bayda, Shahat, Faydia and Gernada given their proximity, relative stability and good governance. As fears of an LNA military operation on Derna are looming, the Sha’hat MC and local branches of the Libyan Red Crescent (LRC) are preparing for a potential IDP flows, in addition to continuing to provide relief to those who already fled. The host communities are unique in that they are islands of representative and inclusive governance in an increasingly militarized East. The responsiveness of the host communities presents an opportunity for moderate governance bodies to showcase their model of governance in contrast to militarized or extremist models of governance.The activity also presents an opportunity for LTI to learn about Derna's internal dynamics via the IDPs and their motivations for leaving.
With support from USAID/OTI, LRC in collaboration with Shahat MC, will preposition emergency relief equipment and provide critical services to Derna's displaced community. These will include first aid kits, mattresses, blankets, NFIs, stretchers, and tents. LRC will develop a distribution plan for IDPs and will be responsible for distributing NFIs and all related equipment to  relief access points in Shahat. The Shahat MC will also implement an outreach campaign to promote the activity and make it more visible to Derna community. By supporting this activity, LTI3 expose Derna's IDPs to the responsiveness of a moderate, elected governance model like the Shahat MC. Since Shahat is an elected stronghold in the militarized East, and since Derna's IDPs have recently lived under extremist influence, this activity will contribute toward LTI objectives of reinforcing moderate values.

The region also faces increasing dictatorial tendencies and militarization of elected municipal councils. 

In Benghazi, the conflict and subsequent militarization resulted in a shrinking civic space. Many activists have been arrested in an attempt to control free speech and independent thinking. LNA liberated Benghazi from the Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council (BRSC), a violent extremist group in July 2016. However, public services and infrastructure were severely damaged by the three-year conflict. Neither the previous municipal council, nor the current militarized one, have provided sufficient support for recovery.

The “23rd of July Park” is located in Benghazi at a previous fault line between BRSC and LNA. The park was once a symbolic and prominent feature of public life which attracted families, festivals, and vendors. Following the three-year fighting, local CSOs organized volunteer efforts to clean the park. However, they lacked the funds to fully complete the rehabilitation and revival. 

With support from USAID/OTI, the BPO will engage various CSOs from Benghazi (mostly formers OTI grantees such as Rugby 2018 and LRC) to rehabilitate the 23rd of July park and organize community engagement activities. LTI will test the BPO through this activity and evaluate response. Rehab works will include the installation of benches, garbage bins, and lighting as well as painting the sidewalk around the park. The activity will aim at establishing an entry point for softer activities in Benghazi which can, overtime, restore civil society and allow for more targeted CVE activities.

This activity seeks to increase Bayda community's confidence and positive perceptions about the Municipal Council (MC), a representative governance body.   Bayda is a critical city in eastern Libya because it is one of the few remaining urban centers in the east with a functioning, democratically elected municipal council that is not run by an appointed military mayor. Over the past year, the MC has resisted several militarization attempts led by the LNA, but was able to push back given its relatively good standing within the community. Access to health services was identified by the community as a priority. Under a previous OTI activity (BEN030), LTI provided an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) to allow the center’s CT scanner to operate during power outages. However, the UPS capacity was not enough to operate the machine. Through this activity, LTI will take corrective action to address the CT scanner issue and support the MC to equip Bayda medical center hospital beds and additional power modules/batteries for the CT scanner. LTI will also support the MC with cleaning and rehabilitating the main entrance of the hospital in coordination with local CSOs in order to increase the activity's visibility.

If : Bayda MC equips Bayda Medical center and upgrades the UPS capacityThen: Bayda residents will have increased awareness of the MC efforts to address their priorities in the health sector Because:1.	Citizens of Bayda identify improved healthcare as a key priority. 2.	Bayda medical center is the main healthcare facility for the city.3.	Promoting Bayda MC’s efforts to equip Bayda medical center will demonstrate its ability and willingness to address community priorities. 4.	This activity will aim to promote the Bayda MC as an inclusive and moderate local government body that can challenge Militarization.

Over the past year, the MC has resisted several militarization attempts led by the LNA, but was able to push back given their relatively good standing within the community. In spite of that, pressure on the MC to demonstrate benefits to the public remains high. 
The Bayda Medical Center is one of the main medical centers servicing the eastern region, and one of the two hospitals in the east that has a CT scanner. Under a previous OTI activity (BEN030), LTI provided an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) to allow the center’s CT scanner to operate during power outages. However, the UPS capacity was not enough to operate the machine. LTI determined that corrective action was needed in order not to undermine the program’s objectives in civilian-governed territories. In addition, the Bayda Medical Center faces a shortage of hospital beds, forcing patients to travel to the nearest public hospital that is often located hundreds of kilometers away, for example in Tobruk, which is 236 km away from Bayda. 
Resolving some of the medical center’s equipment shortages would allow it to receive more patients, including patients from neighboring towns. The  activity targets the residents of Bayda specifically and the Green Mountain villages at large. Facilitating MC support to a notable medical facility will help expand awareness of the role of the elected civilian leadership in Bayda beyond the Bayda community itself. 
The elected Bayda Municipal Council will be the grantee under this activity. The MC is a former LTI partner, and is the local authority that is expected to mobilize services for the community. The MC will closely coordinate with the local office of the Ministry of Health, which will liaise with the Bayda Medical Center management on a technical level. 
LTI will support the Bayda MC by upgrading the UPS so that the existing CT scanner can perform at full capacity during power outages. LTI will also provide 180 hospital beds to accommodate demand for services from citizens of neighboring towns and cities in the Green Mountain Region, so that community’s confidence in elected bodies is increased. LTI will also support the MC to implement an outreach campaign to increase the community’s awareness of the MC’s responsiveness to their priorities by supporting the MC to invite CSOs to help them prepare the hospital for the new equipment. This assistance will support an inclusive representative governance entity to demonstrate benefits to their community.

This activity seeks to improve LTI3 programmatic and strategic decision-making as well as its capacity to effectively evaluate activity outputs and outcomes. LTI3 will engage third-party research and monitoring consortium Voluntas/Diwan to establish a Flexible and efficient Research, analysis, and independent monitoring platform (FRAP). The FRAP will respond to information requests from LTI3 for a period of 12 months, which will allow the program to improve its accountability systems, strategic decision-making, and program learning. By providing reliable information streams on topics of interest and relevance in Libya, the FRAP will allow LTI3 to overcome challenges of working in an information-poor, volatile environment, including reliance on anecdotal and poorly triangulated evidence to identify and evaluate program interventions. The FRAP will also provide robust data from larger sample sizes, to feed into both activity and program level evaluations. 
","
If we build a flexible and efficient research, analysis, and monitoring platform in partnership with Voluntas/Diwan, then we will strengthen feedback loops for programming, strategic decisions, and accountability ofUSG resources in Libya.
Assumptions: 
1. There is a shortage of quantitative and qualitative data available in Libya that are relevant to LTI3 programming and evaluation.
2. Better and more data will allow M&E specialists to better evaluate both activity and higher level results,
3. LTI3’s M&E staff will feed results from enhanced evaluation capacity to PDOs and SMT to improve future programming.
4. Field data collection will continue to be possible in areas of interest. 
5. Speed and flexibility are major factors affecting the quality of the feedback loop between the research, analysis, and monitoring products and the program.
",Flexible Research and Analysis Platform,"
The Libya Transition Initiative 3 (LTI3) is working in an information-poor conflict environment, where dynamics are constantly shifting. High quality, timely research is imperative to ensuring LTI3 programming remains responsive, well-founded, and that staff and management are well-appraised of local developments. Additionally, there are heightened expectations from programs to demonstrate results of U.S. foreign assistance, particularly in Libya, which recently witnessed a surge in USG funding.Given LTI3’s unique standing in Libya and positive relationship with the U.S. embassy based in Tunis, LTI3 is uniquely positioned to feed into policy discussions that impact local partners and the future of all Libyans. LTI3 currently has limited in-house research capacity and local M&E resources are dedicated to targeted activity-level data collection, which solicits feedback from limited sample sizes. LTI3 will kick off higher level evaluations in the coming months that will be used to inform programming, and for which more rigorous methods are required to support internal analysis and reporting.
LTI3’s strategic framework lays out three core pillars of resilience to further fragmentation in Libya: (1) early recovery and local reconciliation in strategic areas that have been recently affected by conflicts, (2) enhanced ability of inclusive, representative governance bodies to demonstrate dividends, (3) reduction of influence of extremist and militant actors in vulnerable communities. In order to continuously refine programming along those three objectives, it is critical that LTI3 has a robust understanding of:
1.  Public perceptions of governance bodies and changes over time
2.  Drivers of recovery and reconciliation and progress over time
3.  Vulnerabilities and resiliencies of communities influenced (or at risk of being influenced) by extremist actors and values.
Moreover, given the unique operational challenges and rapidly shifting dynamics, LTI3 needs a reliable information stream that provides updates on political, security, economic, and social developments in areas where the program is engaged or is interested in engaging. This will allow both Libya-based program staff and LTI3’s remotely based senior management team to triangulate information and ground truth anecdotal evidence. It will also support LTI3's compliance with Section 7041 (g)2.3 of the 2017 Appropriations Act which requires all practicable steps have been taken to ensure that mechanisms are in place for monitoring and oversight of Libya programming. 
The Voluntas-Diwan consortium is composed of the Diwan Market Research, a Tripoli-based research company founded in 2012 and Copenhagen-based Voluntas Advisory, founded in 2011. The consortium has thus far implemented 22 research projects on Libya of different size and scope, including large-scale surveys for international organizations (UNDP, World Bank, WFP) and NGOs (National Democratic Institute) as well as qualitative studies, using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions and other data collection modes for among others Chemonics, UNSMIL, IRI, IFES, the Danish Refugee Council and ABA ROLI.
With support from USAID/OTI Voluntas Advisory and their Libyan consortium partner, Diwan Marketing Research, will establish a research, analysis, and independent monitoring platform (referred to hereafter as the FRAP) for a period of 12 months.   The platform will allow LTI3 to effectively evaluate activities outputs and outcomes as well as inform programming decisions and evaluations. Diwan Marketing Research will manage and supervise day-to-day data collection in Libya while Voluntas will provide analytical, technical and managerial support. In addition, Voluntas is in the process of opening an office in Tunisia, where the Research Manager for this assignment will be located. 
The purpose of the research includes, but is not limited to:
-   Assessing indicators of early recovery and community needs and priorities
-   Understanding political, economic, and social trends that may impact programming in strategic areas/bell-weather areas
-   Measuring public perceptions of LTI3 partners under PO2 (inclusive, representative governance bodies)
-   Carrying out targeted research and analysis to identify drivers of extremism in specific communities
-   Evaluating grant progress and outcomes related to LTI3 cluster evaluations
The purpose of the monitoring includes: 
-   Verifying outputs of a host of recently completed activities, and where relevant, ongoing activities
-   Providing an extra layer of accountability for activities with high risk of resource diversion or giving reputational benefits to DTOs

This activity seeks to facilitate the travel logistics of USAID/OTI Libya Transition Initiative (LTI3) partners to attend key meetings and/or conferences in Tunis. These face-to-face interactions are critical to advance programming within Libya, given the remote nature of programming, and will be used strategically for activity development purposes, to provide key input into strategy discussions and/or to facilitate exchange of ideas with other partners as applicable. Through a direct distribution of goods and services (DDGS) USAID/OTI will provide cash assistance, in the form of travel expense reimbursement, to Libyan partners (local governing entities and civil society organizations) to enable them to contribute to the development and implementation of projects in support of LTI3's objectives. Their input into local needs and priorities will result in more relevant and timely projects, resulting in improved ability of the LTI3 management team to receive timely responses to questions and inputs related to program strategy and design.
","
If LTI3 supports partner travel to Tunis for the purpose of face-to-face discussions of local conditions, priorities and challenges, LTI3 will gain a better understanding of emerging windows of opportunity in Libya, resulting in improved programming, because: 
1. Management staff's travel to Libya will continue to remain impossible for the foreseeable future 
2. Local partners will feel more comfortable and forthcoming in face to face meetings compared to phone or Skype or through an intermediary 
3. Non-mediated, organic discussions built on rapport will allow the management team to be inquisitive and identify unforeseen discussion priorities
 
",Activity Development and Networking: Facilitating Partner Travel to Tunis,"
Although speed is critical for LTI3 activities, as they are being implemented in a highly fluid environment in Libya, the ability to interact with partners and contacts is hindered by the lack of effective or reliable communications in many parts of Libya. The current program management configuration allows limited ability for the management team who sits in Tunis to communicate or interact in person with partners. Under LTI2 staff identified the need for potential partners to meet with management team in person to discuss political context, community priorities and activity specific challenges. These in-person meetings often serve as highly effective means of resolving outstanding issues on ongoing activities, or fostering collaboration and grantee ownership in the development of an activity. Having a mechanism to facilitate local partner travel to Tunis for other reasons - for example, facilitating conference participation or organizing meetings between Libyans and senior US government officials on short notice - also proved beneficial.   While LTI3 will continue to engage field team to facilitate direct communications with partners, these communications cannot replace the value of in-person discussions, where several outstanding issues can be resolved in a single meeting. Furthermore, bringing partners to Tunis for meetings will allow engagement and discussion with the management staff who do not typically have the opportunity to communicate directly with local partners, but who play a critical role in implementing and managing activities. These meetings will also afford LTI3 partners an opportunity to meet one another (if meetings are concurrently scheduled thereby facilitating networking.   This activity will be implemented as a direct distribution of goods and services (DDGS) to support travel-related expenses (lodging, transportation, per diem) that can be drawn on a flexible and as-needed basis for a range of LTI3 partners to meet with LTI3 management team staff, and attend meetings/conferences. The total cost of travel to be reimbursed will be discussed with the grantee in advance, will only cover travel undertaken to attend LTI3 meetings, and will be reimbursed based on the LTI3 transportation policy. Furthermore, individuals receiving travel reimbursement above the nominal amount of $500 must pass vetting prior to receiving funds.

This activity will seek to increase Libyan’s perceptions of the upcoming elections and their results as legitimate. In response to the UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) announcement for several anticipated national electoral events for Libya, including potential presidential and legislative elections and a constitutional referendum, by September 2018, the High National Elections Commission (HNEC) will need to update the national voter registry, which will allow it to determine citizens’ eligibility to register to vote. HNEC is an independent elections commission who is responsible for registering voters. To update the national voter registry, the HNEC will need to draw on data from the Civil Registry Authority (CRA). HNEC has identified an outside contractor that can provide the needed technical expertise, and has identified funds from an INGO that can be used to pay this contractor. However, HNEC still requires IT equipment to support the data transfer, data conversion, and voter registry upgrade. With support from USAID/OTI, LTI will provide HNEC with the needed IT equipment to support its ability to interface with the CRA, receive and convert data, and update the voter registry. By supporting the HNEC to update and ensure the integrity of data in the voter registry, LTI will help increase Libyan’s perceptions of the upcoming elections and their results as legitimate. Having a constitution and elected government that Libyans perceive as legitimate, rather than a fractured national government, will support inclusive, representative governance institutions. .
","
If :The HNEC is equipped to receive and convert data from the CRA, then it will update the voter registry ahead of the elections. 
Assumptions:
1.	Preparations for elections in March 2018 will continue as planned regardless of political and security changes in the coming months. 
2. People will be willing to cooperate with the HNEC and register. 
",Equipping HNEC Voter Registration Update,"
As part of its action plan to amend the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA), the UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) has announced several anticipated national electoral events for Libya, including potential presidential and legislative elections and a constitutional referendum, by September 2018. The High National Elections Commission (HNEC) is Libya’s independent elections commission and is responsible for registering voters and maintaining a voter registry for national elections. To prepare for these electoral events, HNEC will need to update the national voter registry, which will allow it to determine citizens’ eligibility to register to vote. To update the national voter registry, the HNEC will need to draw on data from the Civil Registry Authority (CRA), the national authority responsible for registering Libyan citizens on the civil registryand maintaining the civil registry. The HNEC plans to use the civil registry data to determine citizen eligibility to be on the voter registry.


Currently, HNEC does not have the technical capacity or equipment required to receive data from the CRA and convert it for use in the voter registry. Due to the conflicting national governments in Libya, the HNEC has only received funds to cover staff salaries since 2014 and has had to delay maintenance and the purchase of equipment. HNEC has identified an outside contractor that can provide the requiredtechnical expertise, and has identified funds from the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) that can be used to pay this contractor. However, HNEC still requires IT equipment to support the data transfer, data conversion, and voter registry upgrade.


National elections and a constitutional referendum have the potential to provide inclusive, representative governance institutions for Libya at the national level. If the referendum, elections, and their results are viewed by Libyans as legitimate, they could provide a stable and unified national government that is able to has a mandate to demonstrate progress and benefits on national issues . If the referendum, elections, or their results are viewed as illegitimate, then they could lead factions or spoilers to contest the new national government’s authority as un-inclusive or non-representative.


The integrity of the voter registry, which leads to the ability to register to vote, contributes to perceptions of the legitimacy of elections and their results. Incorrect data – such as deceased persons remaining on the voter registry, or entries missing for young people who were not old enough to register in 2014 – could lead Libyans to view the elections as not credible or fair. The HNEC update of the voter registry will be a first step in laying the foundation for a referendum and national elections that Libyans view as legitimate.


This activity will seek to increase Libyan’s perceptions of the upcoming elections and their results as legitimate. Having a constitution and elected government that Libyans perceive as legitimate, rather than a fractured national government, will support inclusive, representative national governance institutions.


The HNEC has identified the following IT equipment it will need to support its ability to interface with the CRA, receive and convert data, and update the voter registry. This activity will provide the HNEC’s Tripoli headquarters office with the requested in-kind assistance:


-IT equipment to allow for CRA-HNEC data exchange (Cisco Firewall asa 5525-x, two Dell r810 servers; switch network, server rack.)


-Eight laptops for HNEC IT staff


LTI3 will provide IT equipment. HNEC will obtain technical assistance to make the necessary software upgrades to the voter registry platform.

This activity will seek to improve LTI3 ability to design and implement timely and relevant activity. LTI3 is implementing clusters of visible and tangible activities that respond to community priorities, including service delivery needs. LTI3 is partnering with public institutions across Libya to implement projects in various sectors such as WASH, education, health, infrastructure, etc. that are often coupled with outreach campaigns. These projects require specialized technical expertise that both LTI partners and staff often lack. In addition, many of the areas that the program is targeting are still contaminated with mines and unexploded ordnance, which requires site assessments and coordination with relevant demining groups. Such technical assistance is usually required before activity clearance and is used to inform activity design, development and implementation. Through STTA support, LTI3 will hire a pool of experts including specialized engineers (mechanical, electrical, civil, etc.), demining coordinators on need basis, content writers and graphic designer. These  advisers will assist LTI’s program and partners with site assessments and surveys, design review and implementation of projects, specs development, coordination with grantees, relevant entities and contractors, etc. This STTA will contribute to the development and implementation of projects in support of LTI3's objectives.

 If:  Technical advisers provide LTI3 and local partners with specialized assistance in the development and implementation of activities, 


Then:  LTI3 and local partners will design and implement timely, feasible, and strategically-relevant activities,


Because:


- The STTA will resolve grantees' current resource constraints that are slowing down programming


- Providing specialized external support will be sufficient to increase efficiency and relevance of LTI activities. 
",Technical Expertise Support,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Fragile and poorly maintained infrastructure causes major services disruptions, which, in what used to be an upper middle income country, contributes to widespread anger and perceptions of marginalization.  Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, car jacking, and clashes.  Discussion of democratic transition is now limited mostly to elites, while average citizens speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival.  The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing unrest, angst and instability from crossing a point of no return.
The December 2015 signing of the U.N.-backed Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) and its creation of a Government of National Accord (GNA) raised popular optimism and hope in Libya. However, by 2017 approval ratings of the GNA have reached an all-time low.  The GNA’s failure to provide security, deliver basic services, and manage the cash liquidity crisis has destroyed confidence in its ability to govern, and the governance vacuum has forced citizens to rely heavily on municipal councils to provide basic services and address other critical needs. Municipal councils are the only remaining elected bodies in Libya whose mandates haven't expired, and most enjoy higher levels of legitimacy than national level bodies. However, their limited resources and technical capacity often undermine their efforts to address citizen priorities. The failure of the GNA and municipal councils to address citizen priorities is particularly worrisome amid attempts from various spoilers to take advantage of the governance and security and expand its influence. 
In response to these trends, LTI3 is implementing clusters of visible and tangible activities that respond to community priorities, including service delivery needs. LTI3 is partnering with public institutions across Libya to implement projects in various sectors such as WASH, education, health, infrastructure, etc. that are often coupled with outreach campaigns. On an ad hoc basis, these projects can require specialized technical expertise that both LTI partners and staff often lack. In addition, many of the areas that the program is targeting are still contaminated with mines and unexploded ordnance, which requires site assessments and coordination with relevant demining groups. Where the program is able, LTI builds the necessary labor for technical experts into grants. However, in some cases, the team might need to deploy these resources more quickly, or the technical expertise required could be to the benefit of multiple organizations such that there is no single logical grantee. In addition, such technical assistance is usually required before activity clearance and is used to inform activity design, development and implementation. 
Through an STTA mechanism, LTI3 willengage on an as-need basis a pool of experts including specialized engineers (mechanical, electrical, civil, etc.), demining coordinators, content writers and graphic designers. These advisers will assist LTI’s program and partners with site assessments and surveys, design review and implementation of projects, specs development, coordination with grantees, relevant entities and contractors, etc. This STTA will contribute to the development and implementation of projects in support of LTI3's objectives. The advisers' input into local needs and priorities will result in more relevant and timely projects.

This activity allows Mercy Corps, in coordination with the TNC Executive Office of Culture and Civil Society, to help equip and fund the first three months of a Civil Society Resource and Learning Center, Hamzat Wasl, in Benghazi.  The center will allow CSOs an opportunity to increase their ability to network, access information, receive expert consulting, and participate in trainings on mission, proposal development, and advocacy.  To this end, the center offers  a variety of services, including training space, internet stations/work space, a resource library, and a job opportunities board for posting volunteer opportunities for rising young activists.  The grant allowed Mercy Corps and its local partner to secure a building and internal infrastructure (computers, furniture, VSAT, generator, etc.), as well as provide basic capacity building training for CSO actors including the role of civil society in government, mission statement development and strategic planning.  Mercy Corps provided matching funds through a private foundation that will finance operations for an additional three months.

",Civil Society and Governance in Libya - Resource and Learning Centers,"
Under the Jamahiriya, Civil Society Organizations had to go through an extensive and complicated process to register with the government. Any organization that was not registered was illegal, and the process was weighted to discourage civil society formation according to key informants who were active in organizations under Qaddafi, only those who had regime members in the organization were permitted to exist. Even after registration, organizations were ultimately prevented from operating in the true fashion of an open civil society, and thus were not able to develop the skills and competencies essential to success.  After the 17th of February, when NGOs were forming at a rapid pace, they were merely required to register their name and a contact person with the Ministry of Social Affairs. The openness for new organizations and spontaneous energy to respond to the conflict created an environment where the number of organizations registered ballooned from approximately 22 in all of Libya before the revolution to over 150 in Benghazi alone by July 2011.

The National Transitional Council has responded to this demand for representation and rapid growth by forming a new Executive Office of Culture and Civil Society tasked with re-drafting the registration process and overseeing relations between the government and civil society. The Office of Culture and Civil Society is in the final stages of preparing new guidelines for local NGOs, and is going to require all local organizations to re-register. Instead of only providing a name and contact number, NGOs will have to demonstrate a deeper organizational capacity, notably through presenting a charter or constitution. NGOs will have to submit much more detailed information to successfully register.

While this effort is a potentially important step towards encouraging NGOs to think strategically and strengthen their internal frameworks, those that have not previously drafted a constitution or thought about their mission may struggle with the new requirements. Understanding one’s role in civil society is a laudable and crucial goal for the successful existence of any CSO in any country in the world, however the registration process should not be a barrier to local organizations, and the process as it stands now could inadvertently benefit organizations led by individuals of more privileged backgrounds. 

As organizations scramble to fulfill requirements for the registration process, they may miss a valuable opportunity to fully evaluate the goals and mission of their individual organizations and to craft a meaningful constitution/charter in a consultative way. Ultimately, civil society will become a welcome fixture on the Libyan horizon and in order to impact society in a positive way, actors must be given the tools and skills with which to succeed. 

Additionally, many, if not most, organizations do not have office space or internet access, and thus will face additional challenges in organizing and holding professional meetings and will struggle to benefit from the wealth of information available online, including educational resources, case studies and networking opportunities.

After consulting with civil society leaders, local NGO members, and members of the National Transitional Council involved with civil society, INGO Mercy Corps decided to establish a Civil Society Resource and Learning Center in coordination with the Office of Culture and Civil Society Affairs in Benghazi.  A direct grant (as opposed to a GUC) from USAID/OTI of $88,000 to Mercy Corps helped equip and fund the first three months of the Center's operations; Mercy Corps provided matching funds through a private foundation that will finance operations for an additional 3 months.  Mercy Corps is actively exploring sustainable mechanisms, in addition to both private and donor options for follow-on funding, that will support the center's long-term operational costs.

The Center was given the name Hamzat Wasl, a grammatical tool in Arabic that brings sound to silent syllables or in this case, metaphorically speaking, brings capacity to nascent organizations.  Hamzat Wasl is an institution at which all civil society actors from Benghazi and beyond can access information, learn and network, while also providing crucial capacity building support to both civil society. The center offers  a variety of services, including training space, internet stations/work space, a resource library, and will also post a job opportunities board for posting volunteer opportunities for rising young activists both with CSOs and at the center.

",The People's Press: Strengthening Citizen Journalism in Libya,"
Libya’s post-revolution political transition has become derailed amid increasing violence. Voter turnout for legislative elections declined by 20 percentage points between 2012 and 2014, reflecting growing disaffection at the political process. In the east, Operation Dignity was launched in May 2014 to root out extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all-out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments have formed, in alignment with these precarious alliances. Each side has sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fueling instability across Libya. This has created a conducive environment for criminals and extremists to recruit and operate. The country faces increasing polarization, including fears that it could split along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.
In this context, the space for social activism, freedom of speech, and balanced media coverage of current events in Libya has grown very limited. Moderate voices supporting dialogue and peace face significant challenges on multiple fronts. As the Libya Dawn versus Dignity divide has become more entrenched, media outlets and journalists have felt pressure to align with one side. This polarization has flooded the country with biased information that only exacerbates the conflict and feeds public distrust of television channels, social media reporting, and other media outlets. In addition, professional, balanced journalists who have previously worked in traditional media no longer have a space to provide objective reporting. One of the participants in the TRIP132, Social Activism and Digital Security Workshop under LTI, noted that many journalists have lost their jobs because of the restrictions on free speech and increased polarization. Other alumni from the TRIP132 workshop, as well as other activists in contact with LTI 2 staff, have expressed a need to build the skills of citizen journalists to provide an alternative outlet for the dissemination of accurate, objective information. 
Thus, this activity will provide a foundational toolkit to a group of Libya’s civic activists and aspiring citizen-journalists, including several activists with a background in traditional journalism. To accomplish the objective, LTI 2 Social Activism Training Advisor Dalia Haj-Omar (TIP004) will work with a group of international experts in the field of citizen journalism to develop and conduct a eight-day training in Istanbul targeting approximately 25 participants representing all regions of Libya. Some targeted participants are already active bloggers, writers, journalists, photographers, and civic activists in need of new skills to make their work more effective. 

This particular workshop will consist of eight days of training, including (i) one-day session of introduction to citizen journalism, including regional cases studies, challenges, and an analysis of the Libyan context, (ii) three-day session led by Bukeni Waruzi of Witness on video footage, journalism ethics, archiving/preserving footage, human rights documentation, uploading/strategic distribution of content, conducting interviews, and safety/security, (iii) additional three-day training led by the developers of the StoryMaker Android application on the use of the mobile app for producing and distributing content, and finally (iv) one-day wrap up led by Christoph Koette from Amnesty International on tools for verifying user-generated content, including images and video.

This has created a conducive environment for criminals and extremists to recruit and operate. The country faces increasing polarization, including fears that it could split along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.

 

With the departure of the US Embassy from Libya in July, 2014, and the departure of all LTI 2 expatriate personnel from Libya in February 2015, situational awareness and contextual analysis of current social and political trends on the part of USG and LTI 2 specifically has suffered. This has impacted LTI 2's ability to program effectively in Libya and to develop strategies to support Libya's democratic transition. Libya's polarized media landscape has made it more difficult to get grounded, unbiased information from many parts of the country. Conflict and insecurity have made it difficult for LTI 2 national staff to travel freely, further compounding information and analysis gaps. LTI 2 seeks to remain fast and flexible programmatically in order to react to a rapidly evolving political and security situation in Libya. The collapse of many of Libya’s transitional processes in 2014 has ushered in a period of increased political and security uncertainty, highlighting the need to remain both flexible and analytically rigorous to program effectively. As such, LTI 2 seeks to implement a research and analysis platform that is flexible geographically, topically and in terms of timelines and reporting types.

 

This activity addresses these information and analysis needs by establishing a Flexible Research and Analysis Platform (FRAP). This platform will provide a wide range of qualitative and quantitative research capabilities to 1) improve USAID/OTI’s understanding of Libyan social, political and economic conditions to set more responsive strategic direction to the program and 2) support LTI 2's ability to plan, implement and assess evidenced-based programming across the country. The research platform will allow LTI 2 to implement methodologically rigorous qualitative and quantitative data collection across all of Libya’s populated regions based on research objectives developed internally in coordination with OTI. LTI 2 may also use the FRAP to implement research and analysis on cross-border issues which would involve conducting qualitative and quantitative data collection in Tunisia and Niger.

 

The FRAP will provide LTI 2 with a variety of qualitative and quantitative data collection capabilities, including individual depth interviews, focus groups, key individual interviews, and public opinion surveys. Additionally, LTI 2 will be able to choose from a variety of reporting types from Concise Reports to long format Research Reports to best suit specific audiences and purposes. Reports will be shared with a variety of audiences, including LTI 2 program teams, LTI 2 partners and the wider USG and international policy-making community. 

 



The FRAP concept builds on the success of TIP002, the Governance and Stability Assessment, a five month activity designed as an integrated, iterative, knowledge generation process incorporating media monitoring, public opinion polling, and a robust request for research process to support LTI 2 objectives in SW Libya. The GSA validated the concept of an integrated, flexible research and analysis capability that provides a menu of research and analysis options with specific topics for research defined on a rolling basis in response to evolving events in Libya and LTI 2 programming requirements. Research objectives will be validated and prioritized by the Research Working Group made up of LTI 2 Chief of Party, Research and Analysis Director, Senior Transition Advisor, and OTI Country Representative. Research work plans will be developed on 3-4 month time horizons and will include multiple concurrent research projects. This activity will provide a steady stream of robust research and analytical products that will help LTI 2 plan and implement activities more effectively in the current dynamic political and security environment in Libya and help the project maintain strategic value and impact.

Libya's polarized media landscape has made it more difficult to get grounded, unbiased information from many parts of the country. Conflict and insecurity have made it difficult for LTI 2 national staff to travel freely, further compounding information and analysis gaps. LTI 2 seeks to remain fast and flexible programmatically in order to react to a rapidly evolving political and security situation in Libya. The collapse of many of Libya’s transitional processes in 2014 has ushered in a period of increased political and security uncertainty, highlighting the need to remain both flexible and analytically rigorous to program effectively. As such, LTI 2 seeks to implement a research and analysis platform that is flexible geographically, topically and in terms of timelines and reporting types.



This activity addresses these information and analysis needs by establishing a Flexible Research and Analysis Platform (FRAP). This platform will provide a wide range of qualitative and quantitative research capabilities to 1) improve USAID/OTI’s understanding of Libyan social, political and economic conditions to set more responsive strategic direction to the program and 2) support LTI 2's ability to plan, implement and assess evidenced-based programming across the country. The research platform will allow LTI 2 to implement methodologically rigorous qualitative and quantitative data collection across all of Libya’s populated regions based on research objectives developed internally in coordination with OTI. LTI 2 may also use the FRAP to implement research and analysis on cross-border issues which would involve conducting qualitative and quantitative data collection in Tunisia and Niger.



The FRAP will provide LTI 2 with a variety of qualitative and quantitative data collection capabilities, including individual depth interviews, focus groups, key individual interviews, and public opinion surveys. Additionally, LTI 2 will be able to choose from a variety of reporting types from Concise Reports to long format Research Reports to best suit specific audiences and purposes. Reports will be shared with a variety of audiences, including LTI 2 program teams, LTI 2 partners and the wider USG and international policy-making community. 







The FRAP concept builds on the success of TIP002, the Governance and Stability Assessment, a five month activity designed as an integrated, iterative, knowledge generation process incorporating media monitoring, public opinion polling, and a robust request for research process to support LTI 2 objectives in SW Libya. The GSA validated the concept of an integrated, flexible research and analysis capability that provides a menu of research and analysis options with specific topics for research defined on a rolling basis in response to evolving events in Libya and LTI 2 programming requirements. Research objectives will be validated and prioritized by the Research Working Group made up of LTI 2 Chief of Party, Research and Analysis Director, Senior Transition Advisor, and OTI Country Representative. Research work plans will be developed on 3-4 month time horizons and will include multiple concurrent research projects. This activity will provide a steady stream of robust research and analytical products that will help LTI 2 plan and implement activities more effectively in the current dynamic political and security environment in Libya and help the project maintain strategic value and impact.

This activity will improve the ability of key female civil society leaders to support women in developing initiatives that promote dialogue and non-violence in their communities. These initiatives will ultimately help carve out a more active role for women in the national dialogue and peacebuilding and transition processes. LTI 2 will support Medmaar in developing and implementing a Training of Trainers (TOT) workshop in Istanbul for 21 female civil society leaders and activists. Following the TOT workshop, participants will lead community-level trainings and help women in their communities develop subsequent advocacy campaigns that promote dialogue and non-violent solutions to conflict and social and political problems. Medmaar Institute, founded by experienced, educated female professionals, aims to contribute to the social progress in Libyan society through training and awareness programs that address negative social trends and problems. 
","
This activity assumes that increasing the skills and knowledge of key female civil society leaders to support peace and dialogue advocates in their communities will lead to stronger grassroots female-led initiatives in support of dialogue and non-violent solutions to social and political problems. This is because a key impediment to strengthening women's role in advocating for dialogue and non-violence in Libya is the lack of skills and knowledge among women civil society activists. 
",Women Advocating for Peace,"
Libya’s post-revolution political transition became derailed in 2014. In the east, Operation Dignity was launched in May 2014 to root out extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all-out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments formed in alignment with these alliances, increasing polarization and raising fears that Libya could split along regional lines. Each side sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fuelling instability across Libya. More recently, conflict fatigue has set it in, prompting popular calls for peace. Stability has increased in many neighborhoods of Benghazi following successes by Operation Dignity while local reconciliation initiatives have proliferated in western Libya. A fragile, UN-sponsored peace agreement was signed by some parties to the conflict in Morocco in July 2015. However, instability persists, particularly between ethnic groups in Southern Libya. The Islamic State is making headway in central Libya, capitalizing on the vacuum of authority. Powerful spoilers remain outside of the recent agreements, making the immediate future unclear.
LTI 2 provides support to advocates of dialogue and non-violence to collaborate, debate and build consensus. Women have the potential to represent a powerful group in any society as they can have much social influence on their male counter parts. Less than a 100 years ago, women in America fought hard to exercise the right to vote after many years of speeches, petitions and marches. This year, Germany passed legislation awarding women a third of board seats on private corporations. In post-Jasmine revolution Tunisia, women rallied to ensure they maintained their equal status rights under the new constitution. In Libya, leading women activists succeeded in pressuring the political parties to increase women’s participation in decision making through the establishment of quotas on the legislative parliament and municipal councils. This last example illustrates that Libyan women can influence the peace process and can contribute even more during the transitional period.
This activity will support 21 female Libyan activists from the East, West, and South to build their capabilities as leaders and mobilizers in their communities by first conducting a training of trainers (TOT) on advocacy and the role of women in peace and transitional processes. Then, the grantee and LTI 2 will work with this group to develop and implement trainings targeting broader audiences in their home communities in Libya. The goal is these training initiatives will ultimately lead to female-led advocacy campaigns that promote dialogue and non-violent solutions to divisive issues. The women activists will be selected in collaboration between the grantee and LTI 2 and receive training in arbitration and peacebuilding, as well as women’s role in promoting and disseminating the values of peace. The TOT workshop will be led by Dr. Asha Elkarib and Azaz Elshami. 
LTI 2 will assist Medmaar in its implementation of the TOT workshop in Istanbul, Turkey by supporting logistics, trainers, and training material for women activist leaders. LTI 2 will also cover costs of travel, lodging, trainers and site services. The participants will come from Tripoli, Benghazi, Sebha, and their surrounding communities and wlll have strong networking relationships within their communities to ensure the development of a successful outreach movement. Medmaar Institute, founded by experienced, educated female professionals, aims to contribute to the social progress in Libyan society through training and awareness programs that address negative social trends and problems.

This activity enhances the ability of LTI2 and Municipal Councils to deliver community engagement projects throughout Libya by supporting Regional Engineers through short-term technical assistance (STTA). Under technical supervision of Chemonics STTA Engineer, the Regional Engineers provide technical oversight over the engineering firms subcontracted to provide small-scale infrastructure and rehabilitation services in public spaces and buildings, and specifically, conduct site assessments, design review, and milestone verification and provide general quality assurance and quality control. LTI2’s commitment to help strengthen Municipal Councils requires the ability to implement clusters of visible, tangible community engagement projects that help boost government legitimacy and bolster public confidence in local authorities. The STTAs will help develop grantee and community partner capacity, processes, and ensure appropriate management of activities in the 12 locations.

Libya’s post-revolution political transition became derailed in 2014.

In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments formed in alignment with these alliances, increasing polarization and raising fears that Libya could split along regional lines.

More recently, conflict fatigue has set it in, prompting popular calls for peace. A fragile, UN-sponsored peace agreement was signed by some parties to the conflict in Morocco in July 2015 while local reconciliation initiatives have proliferated in western Libya. Powerful spoilers remain outside of these agreements, making the immediate future unclear.
Following the bifurcation of Libya’s national legislative and executive branches in 2014, the country’s municipal councils, established a year earlier, remain as its most legitimate democratic authority. According to LTI-sponsored research under TRIP135 in Tripoli, 72 per cent of respondents perceived the councils as having a great deal or fair amount of legitimacy, significantly higher than either of the national legislatures. However, following the slowdown and eventual halt in the disbursal of national revenues as a result of the conflict, the municipal councils currently lack resources to exercise their authority and establish credibility among their constituents. The TRIP134 survey recorded that only 1 per cent of respondents perceived the councils to wield the most authority in Libya’s capital. Bridging the yawning gap between the legitimacy and authority of the municipal councils will help to establish the citizen-state relationship and invigorate waning public support for Libya’s democratic transition.
With intention to support this process, LTI2 is assisting municipal councils in 12 towns across Libya in implementing tangible community engagement projects to encourage greater social interaction in local communities and build public confidence in local government's ability to deliver services. By bringing together local authorities, civil society, and community members to deliver practical projects, these activities aim to build relationships among key stakeholders and increase visibility of municipal councils in their areas. 
As a part of this effort, LTI2 will fund STTA local engineers to support municipal councils and the program in overseeing public, small-scale infrastructure and rehabilitation projects. Under technical supervision of Chemonics STTA Engineer, the local Engineers will provide technical oversight over the engineering firm subcontracted to install the playgrounds, and specifically, conduct site assessments, design review, and milestone verification and provide general quality assurance and quality control. The local engineers will actively coordinate with municipal councils, regional teams and the subcontractor to ensure timely roll out and completion of project activities.

Under the UNSMIL-led Libyan Political Dialogue, some parties to the conflict agreed to the core text of a fragile peace agreement in July 2015 in Morocco, and on October 9 the UN Special Envoy for Libya announced a unity government with proposed candidates for Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Ministers. On December 17, representatives from both sides signed the final agreement in Morocco. UNSMIL and the new GNA is currently working to rally a critical mass in Libya to support the agreement, but neither the Tripoli-based GNC nor the internally-recognized HOR in Tobruk have backed it yet. Meanwhile, Libyan-led efforts to forge an alternative agreement have emerged, and powerful spoilers on both sides remain opposed to all agreements, making the immediate future unclear. 

Given the present fragility of the new unity government and the need to rally public support in favor of the political agreement, LTI 2 is continuing a national campaign under the banner of ""let's agree now - on our united future"" in collaboration with influential Libyan CSOs. As we enter into this second, GNA formation phase of the campaign, LTI 2 aims to continue to increase active public support for the UNSMIL Libyan political agreement and formation of a Government of National Accord. In addition, LTI 2 will begin to educate the public about and buttress the legitimacy of the new GNA and its immediate priorities.

Specifically, ISDD will engage a coalition of academics representing all areas of Libya to draft a statement collating the most significant consequences of conflict in Libya during the past 2 years, backed by empirical evidence. The statement will conclude with an explanation for why the GNA is the only alternative to continued chaos, and it will outline a few consensus recommendations from the academic community for the GNA's efforts to address those issues. ISDD will then lobby well-known academics and intellectuals from all areas of Libya to sign the statement, and after a critical mass is reached, ISDD will conduct simultaneous press conferences in all 3 regions to announce the statement and the commencement of a 2-week advocacy campaign to enlist other academics, civil society leaders, tribal elders, and political/military leaders to sign on to the statement of support for the GNA and advocate for the agreement in their communities. The grassroots campaign will be implemented by ISDD's network of volunteers in 8 regions: Tripoli, Sabha, Misrata, Zawiya, Zintan, Bayda, Tobruk, and Benghazi. The end goal is to boost grassroots support for the GNA and identify and enlist key influencers in these areas to advocate on behalf of the GNA. 

ISDD is a think tank and advocacy group focused on governance, democracy, and human rights. The organization and its staff sit in Bayda/Benghazi, Tunis, and Amman, and it emerged out of the University of Benghazi academic community.

This activity aims to encourage public support for the Libyan political agreement and the formation of a Government of National Accord. In order to accomplish this objective, LTI 2 is supporting the ""let's agree now"" campaign nationally to rally public support for the GNA and educate Libyans about the Libyan political agreement through radio adverts, video PSAs, social media, and local town hall events and campaigns. This short-term technical assistance activity, specifically, will engage a part-time Libyan media advisor - Ahmed Bhih - to negotiate content distribution with radio and TV outlets nationwide. Mr. Bhih is a well-connected media professional in Libya, with experience leading media-focused NGOs, advising government communications offices both nationally and locally, and marketing in the private sector.

This short-term technical assistance activity, specifically, will engage a part-time Libyan media advisor to negotiate content distribution with radio and TV outlets nationwide. In coordination with the other elements of the broader campaign, the effort will encourage public support and pressure for the Libyan political agreement and formation of a Government of National Accord.
",Let's Agree Now on our United Future:Strengthening Distribution of Media Content,"
Libya’s post-revolution political transition became derailed in 2014. In the east, Operation Dignity was launched in May 2014 to root out extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all-out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments formed in alignment with these alliances, increasing polarization and raising fears that Libya could split along regional lines. Each side sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fueling instability across Libya. More recently, conflict fatigue has set it in, prompting popular calls for peace. Stability has increased in many neighborhoods of Benghazi following successes by Operation Dignity, while local reconciliation initiatives have proliferated in western Libya. However, instability persists, particularly between ethnic groups in Southern Libya. The Islamic State is making headway in central Libya, capitalizing on the vacuum of authority. Powerful spoilers remain outside of the recent agreements, making the immediate future unclear.



Under the UNSMIL-led Libyan Political Dialogue, some parties to the conflict agreed to the core text of a fragile peace agreement in July 2015 in Morocco, and on October 9 the UN Special Envoy for Libya announced a unity government with proposed candidates for Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Ministers. On December 17, representatives from both sides signed the final agreement in Morocco. UNSMIL and the new GNA is currently working to rally a critical mass in Libya to support the agreement, but neither the Tripoli-based GNC nor the internally-recognized HOR in Tobruk have backed it yet. Also, powerful spoilers on both sides remain opposed to all agreements, paving a challenging road ahead for the GNA. 

Given the present fragility of the new unity government and the need to rally public support in favor of the political agreement, LTI 2 is continuing a national campaign under the banner of ""let's agree now - on our united future"" in collaboration with influential Libyan CSOs. LTI 2 is increasing active public support for the UNSMIL Libyan political agreement and formation of a GNA. In addition, LTI 2 is educating the public about and buttress the legitimacy of the new GNA and its immediate priorities. Once the GNA starts functioning, LTI 2 will enter a 3rd campaign phase to establish the role of the citizen and inspire shared responsibility for the GNA's success. 

The purpose of this small STTA activity is to hire a Libyan media advisor to facilitate distribution of video and radio content to media outlets throughout Libya. The media advisor, Ahmed Bhih, will work closely with all grantees creating content such as Momken, H2O, and Volunteer Libya to facilitate its distribution. At the beginning of the ""let's agree now"" campaign, LTI envisioned that each individual grantee would assume responsibility for media distribution. However, this approach had limited success and it makes sense to engage a media advisor for a couple of reasons. First, the work of negotiating with media outlets is laborious, particularly given the political affiliations of most outlets. The media sector relies heavily on personal relationships, and most want to view and understand the content before it is aired. Given the political bent of most campaign material, LTI and grantees have also fielded a lot of questions about what we are doing, funding source, objectives of the content, etc. Particularly for these sensitive conversations, a clear, common message is needed. Second, it is much more efficient and strategic for one person to liaise with all media outlets and represent the campaign. If multiple grantees are independently trying to air content, some economies of scale are missed. 

After reviewing several candidates, LTI staff in Tripoli proposed Ahmed Bhih as the best candidate for this part-time role. For 5 years, Ahmed served as the head of Step-by-Step NGO, which was an LTI partner on multiple communications and public outreach activities after the revolution. He also worked closely as a media advisor for the Prime Minister's office in 2013 and for Tripoli local council in 2015. Prior the revolution, he worked in marketing in the private sector.

This activity aims to increase the sense of urgency around the need for the unity government and encourage public support for the LPA. In order to achieve this objective, LTI 2 will support Lines LTD to produce and distribute a video under the ""Let's Agree Now"" campaign highlighting the issue of IDPs and encouraging a Unity government. The video will focus particularly on the suffering of young children as IDPs representing different parts of the country and sharing their hopes for a better future. Message in the video will reinforce the urgency of having united national governance and highlight sections of the LPA that deal with IDP issues. This video will support the ""Let's Agree Now"" campaign, which  LTI 2 is implementing in coordination with other partners across Libya. Lines LTD members are active in civil society and have been particularly advocating for IDP issues. 
","
If LTI supports the grantee to produce and distribute the IDP video with information about the GNA role in addressing IDP issues, then we will highlight the human cost of the lack of a national government, increase urgency around supporting a unity government, and encourage public support for the LPA as the solution to address these issues.

- This assumes that public ignorance about these human costs undermines the sense of urgency of having unity government. 

- It also assumes that highlighting direct statements about how the LPA addresses these urgent issues will encourage public support for the agreement. 

- It assumes that the IDP problem is a major public concern that cuts across regional, tribal, and political divides. 
",Let's Agree Now: IDPs Hope and the GNA Solution,"
At the beginning of 2016, Libya’s political future is more uncertain than at any time since the 2011 revolution. Political division, armed conflict and a crisis of legitimacy at the national level have accelerated the fragmentation of Libya’s governance landscape. Regional coalitions which formed in 2014 have fractured during 2015 and cities and municipalities have become increasingly isolated. Libya’s two nominal national governments both exert little authority outside their respective bases in Tripoli and Tobruk. The political elites involved in the UN-sponsored dialogue to form a unity government lack legitimacy and the country lacks a national political leadership that can claim a mandate to negotiate a solution to Libya’s crises. The collapse of the national-level political process and institutions has shifted significant governance responsibilities to local formal and informal actors. Municipal councils are viewed as the most credible institutions, though they face serious challenges to providing services to their constituents. The collapse of state institutions and the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security vacuum to strengthen its presence in Libya. After over a year of dialogue, representatives from various political factions signed the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) in Morocco in late 2015. The new Government of National Accord is (GNA) is currently working to rally support for the agreement and establish its authority and legitimacy in country. A critical mass of support is beginning to grow, particularly from the general public and many municipal councils, but powerful spoilers on both sides remain opposed to the agreement. Furthermore, successive rounds of polling in Libya throughout 2015 have revealed an increasingly strong disdain for national political institutions and actors, and Libyans are disillusioned with the failure of previous transitional efforts at the national level. Given the present fragility of the new GNA and the need to rally public support in favor of the political agreement, LTI 2 is partnering with influential Libyan CSOs and media outlets to increase active public support for the GNA. In addition, LTI 2 is educating the public about the political agreement and the GNA's immediate priorities. 



A large part of these efforts are continuing through a national campaign under the banner of ""let's agree now - on our united future"" in collaboration with influential Libyan CSOs. Currently, the campaign is using social media, radio, and television to educate the public about and buttress the legitimacy of the new GNA and its immediate priorities. Part of the campaign's focus is to highlight major issues or problems that have emerged in Libya as a result of the political conflict and lack of a national government. Then, different media tools can highlight the GNA's mandate for addressing those issues. This activity will focus on presenting the IDPs issue and educating people about solutions provided for the issue as mentioned in the LPA.



 LTI will support the grantee to produce a video highlighting IDP issues in all regions of Libya similar to the NAT008 and TIP012 videos. It will include 5 to 6 scenes with young IDP children representing different cities (e.g., Mashashiya, Kikla, Tawergha, Benghazi). The video will present IDP’s suffering and deliver messages from young children wishing for a better future. The video will be under Let’s Agree Now campaign. Between each clip, there will be printed messages to reinforce the message of urgency of having united national governance and highlight sections of the LPA that deal with IDP issues. Grantee will provide for most of the production. LTI will support media coverage and social media distribution of the video. LTI may provide some billboards including photos from the video.

This activity aims to promote interaction between the GNA media office and Libyan media outlets. To achieve this objective, LTI will support Mubader center to organize one day seminar that brings national and local media outlets with the GNA media office in Tripoli. LTI's support for this event falls under our broader, national campaign ""our shared responsibility,"" which is working to connect citizens, municipal councils, and the GNA. The sessions will take place in Tripoli, however, it will involve nationwide media outlets. The event will mainly focus on presenting the GNA media office representatives and reinforce the message of cooperation between the media office and the media outlets. The event will target Libyan media outlets and the PC/GNA media office. It is targeting them to promote for interaction and to strengthen the working relationship and communication between media outlets and GNA media office.  The GNA media office needs to build a positive relationship with the media to effectively get its messages out to the public. The media need to build a positive relationship with the media office for access to the GNA and to effectively cover the transition period and beyond. Mubader center is a trust CSO and civil society resource center in Western Libya - based in Zawiay. Given its ties to both the GNA and Libyan media outlets, LTI is partnering with Mubader Center to serve as the host and facilitator of the session. 
","
If LTI supports Mubader center to organize a one day seminar that brings national and local media outlets with the GNA media office in Tripoli, it will strengthen positive, professional cooperation between media outlets and GNA/PC media office because:

· We assume that the relationship between the GNA media office and the media outlets are weak and this undermines the GNA’s ability to effectively communicate with the public,get its message out, and build public confidence in its progress.

· We assume that a one-day seminar that gathers all these stakeholders is a necessary first step in addressing the weak government/GNA-media relations in Libya.      
. We assume that the seminar and topics proposed and the facilitators will provide the proper forum for encouraging interaction and starting to build norms between these 2 sides.

· We assume that this exchange will help make the 2 sides more aware of each other’s constraints, capacity, and expectations.

· We assume that the Mubader Center is a proper interlocutor for the session, based on their strong ties to the GNA and to media outlets

After over a year of dialogue, representatives from various political factions signed the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) in Morocco in late 2015.

A critical mass of support is beginning to grow, particularly from the general public and many municipal councils, but the new government's legitimacy is fragile and powerful spoilers remain opposed to the agreement. Furthermore, successive rounds of polling in Libya throughout 2015 have revealed an increasingly strong disdain for national political institutions and actors, and Libyans are disillusioned with the failure of previous transitional efforts at the national level. Given the present fragility of the new GNA and the need to rally public support in favor of the political agreement, LTI 2 is partnering with trusted local actors such as municipal councils and civil society to increase active public support for the GNA. In addition, LTI 2 is educating the public about the political agreement and the GNA's immediate priorities.

Supporting the development of a positive relationship between the GNA and the Libyan media is an important part of these efforts to increase public support for the GNA and ensure the public has good, accurate information about the GNA's progress. However, a key problem is the lack of relationships or any norms for professional cooperation between the GNA media office and Libyan media outlets. The media office is new, recently arrived in Tripoli, has weak ties to the Libyan press, and lacks the infrastructure and knowledge for effectively engaging with a complex media landscape in Libya. On the other hand, expectations from the media outlets are high, and they don't understand why they don't have the chance to interact more regularly with the PC and its media office. At a broader level, no norms exist for government-media relations, and the two sides do not understand their respective roles in that relationship. 



This activity is a first step in addressing this problem. In order to get their message across, communicate effectively with the public, and strengthen public confidence in their progress, it is important for the GNA to establish a positive, professional relationship with the Libyan press through its media office. This activity will support LTI partner Mubader center to conduct a one-day seminar targeting GNA media office and media outlets in an initiative to break the ice between both sides.  The event will focus on building a positive, professional relationship and interaction between the Libyan media and the PC through its media office. The event will consist of 4 sessions: The first will be opened by a PC member welcoming the attendees and calling for building constructive relations between government media office and media outlets, followed by 3 presentations. The session will be followed by open discussions on the presented topics to help the two sides start to develop norms for interaction. This activity will also provide LTI further entree to the PC and its Media Office through a trusted LTI partner, with the intent of building the foundation for further work and collaboration with the Media Office and thus growing LTI’s strategic communications work with the GNA. The event will launch the new phase of LTI's Strategic communications campaign "" Our Shared Responsibility"" and through this event LTI will promote the new campaign with some printed materials and a short video to present the campaign.

This activity seeks to strengthen LTI 2's ability to design, implement, and assess activities to increase positive public perceptions of the GNA and to counter violent extremism in Sabratha. In order to achieve this objective, LTI 2 will work with ASU's CSRC to set up and refine a LookingGlass tool that will allow for the real-time monitoring of the sentiment and discourse around the GNA and violent extremism on Libyan social media. The LG platform will have a graphical user interface that will allow LTI 2 users to explore the geographical variation, content, common themes, and sentiment of social media activity around the GNA. This will allow LTI 2 to develop more targeted and effective social media content and to better target other activities to build positive public perceptions of the GNA and to counter violent extremism. The LG platform will provide an additional capability that will allow for evaluating the spread and impact of LTI 2 social media activities, strengthening LTI 2's ability to evaluate its impact and design more effective activities in support of the GNA and to counter violent extremism.

After over a year of dialogue, representatives from various political factions signed the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) in Morocco in late 2015. In March 2016, the Presidency Council of Libya's new Government of National Accord moved from Tunis to Tripoli. In May, the PC announced the GNA had commenced work from Libya's capital. While the GNA is working to rally support in Libya and it seems for the time being Libyans are willing to give the new government the benefit of the doubt, powerful spoilers remain outside the process and Libyans are expressing frustrations about the lack of tangible achievements. Additionally, the security and political chaos has allowed for the continued expansion of extremist groups like the Islamic State. While Libyans are united against the Islamic State, many other indigenous extremist groups continue to exist in a complex web of militias and armed groups. In order to better work to increase positive perceptions of the GNA and bolster its credibility with Libyans, it is essential that LTI 2 better understand the complex political and security environment and the dynamics of discourse around national government, particularly on social media, to facilitate more effective programming.As part of its strategic communications campaign in support of the GNA, LTI 2 has supported a significant number of activities that focus on distributing content in support of the GNA over social media. This includes supporting the ""Let's Agree Now"" Facebook page as a platform for the campaign, and supporting the development and distribution of videos and infographics that have been distributed through the social media platform. Additionally, LTI 2 may explore social media outreach as part of its countering violent extremism objective. Despite LTI 2's significant activity on social media, the program lacks rigorous tools for both analyzing the social media landscape in Libya around the issues of national governance and violent extremism, and assessing the impact that LTI 2 social media activities may or may not be having on the wider debate around these issues.In order to deepen LTI 2's awareness of the social media landscape and better assess social media activities, this activity will provide a grant to Arizona State University's Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict  to develop a LookingGlass platform that will allow LTI to conduct real time analysis of political and security developments related to the national government and violent extremism. LookingGlass is a technological platform that tracks social movements and allows for real-time analysis of complex sociopolitical contexts. During phase 1 of the activity, ASU will develop a LookingGlass customized to the Libyan context to provide LTI 2 with information and insight to meet LTI 2’s strategic objectives of increasing positive public perception of the GNA and countering the ability of violent extremist groups to operate in Sabratha. ASU's LookingGlass will provide an online graphical interface that will allow LTI 2 users to: explore the relative size and geographic distribution of active social media groups; identify influential online supporters or opponents of the GNA; and show daily trending sentiment for or against the GNA. This will help LTI 2 better design programmatic responses as part of the strategic communications campaign. For phase 2 of the activity, ASU will develop for LookingGlass a tool for tracking the diffusion of LTI 2 social media content to better understand how the material is perceived and shared on social media. This will strengthen LTI 2's ability to evaluate the impact of program social media content.

IF LTI provides communications and media training and equipment for Presidency Council Media Administration and GNA ministries' media offices, supports their Facebook pages, and supports practical capstone exercises in each training, THEN the media office demonstrates increased capacity to update the public, media outlets and GNA/ PC Media Administration about the ministries news.

Assumptions:

•	The media offices want to communicate with the media and public, but most staff lack necessary knowledge, skills, and access to equipment.

•	The GNA media administrations' (including ministries) weak internal structures, coordination, and processes also undermine capacity to communicate with the public. This problem is a separate, more complex issue and will not be directly addressed by this activity.

•The capstone exercises will provide hands-on, practical opportunities to practice lessons learned and demonstrate increased capacity. We assume the GNA ministries and PC will be able to provide positive content for these exercises

•	The media offices staff will have time, interest, and ability to maintain Facebook pages following the training.

•	The media offices will be empowered to speak publicly and to engage with the press, and they will have access to ministry and presidency council officials to get the information they need

•	The GNA institutions involved have selected the most appropriate representatives/individuals to participate in the training, and these individuals will remain engaged and motivated in their work with the ministries


",Supporting Communication Capacity of the GNA Media Administration and Ministries,"
Since the signing of the Libya Political Agreement (LPA) in late 2015, Libya’s political future is hopeful but fragile. A new Government of National Accord (GNA) is working to help the country recover from two years of violent conflict between regional political factions. Despite strong support from the international community, powerful spoilers – particularly in the East – continue to challenge the GNA. Also, entrenched disdain for national level governance and rapidly eroding quality of life undermines the GNA’s credibility. Meanwhile, municipal councils have assumed significant governance responsibilities over the past 2 years, and they are still viewed as the most credible institutions. However, they face serious challenges in providing services to their constituents and are disconnected from national level counterparts and other local actors. Finally, the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security dysfunction to strengthen its influence.
At the national level, the new GNA is struggling to gain legitimacy and authority, largely because of its weak capacity for public outreach and communications. Meanwhile powerful detractors continue to grow in influence, undermine the GNA, and spread misinformation. Furthermore, successive rounds of polling in Libya have revealed strong disdain for national political institutions and actors, and Libyans are disillusioned with the failure of previous national transitional efforts. In response, LTI 2 is helping the GNA and its proponents at the local level educate people about its mandate, engage ordinary Libyans in the political transition process, and communicate its progress in addressing citizens’ priorities. Specifically, at the national level, LTI 2 is focusing on direct support the Presidency Council in its public outreach and communications efforts – primarily through the PC media office and GNA ministries. 
In May, the GNA ministries received authorization to commence their work, and they started staffing their media offices over the summer. At the same time, the Presidency Council established the GNA Media Administration to coordinate communications on behalf of the presidency council and all ministries and national government departments. Under NAT012, LTI 2 conducted a pilot activity with the GNA Media Administration - a one day seminar involved Media Administration members and Libyan media outlets. These media outlets expressed the need to improve communications and receive more frequent news from the GNA. However, most of the GNA media administration is severely under-resourced. Most staff are new. They lack skills, equipment, and systems for effective internal and external communications. This lack of interaction and communication with the public via traditional and social media is one of the greatest challenges to the GNA's legitimacy. 
In this activity, LTI 2 will support the GNA Media Administration to conduct 3 months of training for its staff and the communications staff of 10 other national government institutions including the ministries of health, education, transportation, justice, social affairs, foreign affairs, youth and sport, and culture. The training will consist of 2 tracks. The first track with 11 trainees focuses on news reporting, writing press releases, press conferences, developing story lines for PSAs, digital security, and social media. The second track with 20 participants focuses on video production and editing, photography/Photoshop, covering press releases and speeches, and social media. As a part of each training module, the participants will produce tangible deliverables and products to help the GNA and its ministries start communicating. In addition, LTI will provide communications equipment to the GNA Media Administration and ministries for use during the training courses and after the training. Deeding of equipment to participant institutions will require successful completion of the training and deliverables. The Tripoli University Communications and Media Department is providing local expert trainers in each module who are responsible for developing and delivering courses and overseeing the completion of practical exercises and deliverables.

This activity aims to help the Government of National Accord/Presidency Council and its media administration create dialogue opportunities between national level decision makers and ordinary Libyans about critical issues of public concern. To help achieve this objective, LTI 2 will support the GNA media administration to conduct 3 social media campaigns and 3 corresponding televised town hall forums to address public questions about liquidity, electricity, and security. Depending on the outcomes of the first 3 sessions, LTI 2 and the GNA media administration may expand this activity to conduct further sessions. The town hall forums will include media outlets, civil society activists, university lecturers and experts, GNA and governmental institutions representatives - including guests from the East and the South of Libya. During the forums, a panel of experts will discuss and respond to questions and concerns shared by Libyans through the social media platform, which will seek public input in the 5 days leading up to each session. Media office staff will provide updates live during the sessions on social media, and the town hall forum will be distributed on Rasmiya television and sent to other TV channels, local radio, and new websites immediately following the event. Negative perceptions of and/or lack of information about the GNA have made it difficult for the new government to gain legitimacy and advance its agenda.The lack of interaction and communication with the public via traditional and social media is one of the greatest challenges feeding negative perceptions, and this activity aims to build the GNA's efforts to address that problem.

If LTI 2 supports the GNA to conduct social media campaigns and televised town hall forums to address public questions about liquidity, electricity, and security, THEN the GNA can strengthen dialogue mechanisms between national level decision makers and Libyans about critical issues of public concern, BECAUSE:
- Liquidity, electricity, and security issues are critical issues of public concern that Libyans want to discuss.
- Part of the public is willing to listen to/engage with the GNA.
- Participants from the South and East can engage constituencies in their regions.
- The PC /GNA media administration strengthens its communications with media outlets and the public through the seminars. 
- Facebook and TV are effective tools for mobilizing public engagement

However, most of the GNA media administration is severely under-resourced. They lack the sufficient funds to cover the expenses of national level events, regular meetings, and press conferences. This lack of direct interaction and communication with the public via traditional and social media is one of the greatest challenges to the GNA's legitimacy. Additionally, focus group outcomes from LTI's ""Let's Agree Now"" cluster of activities in the first half of 2016 strongly suggest that people prefer to hear from decision makers and key actors directly. So, in addition to providing communications and media training and equipment for the media administration, LTI 2 has started supporting the GNA and its media administration to hold public events, press conferences, and seminars in Libya. The first of these events occurred under NAT016 in December. LTI 2 supported the GNA to hold a seminar about the outcomes of the London Economic Summit, and the initiative received a lot of positive attention and press coverage in Libya. In this activity, LTI 2 will support the GNA Media Administration to conduct forums to help national decision makers connect and dialogue with Libyan citizens and communities. The GNA media administration will conduct three televised town hall forums which will involve around 40-50 participants from GNA and PC representatives, media outlets, CSOs, university lecturers and activists - including South and East region participants. The gatherings will discuss 3 different topics that address electricity issues, cash liquidity, and security. The gatherings will be filmed and shared with media outlets and on the PC/GNA media administration YouTube channel as well as aired on Alrasmiya TV, which is the media sponsor for the forums. Also, the content of the discussions will be posted on the forum Facebook page, on the PC/GNA media administration Facebook page and on Bawabat Almajles news website. An audio copy of the gatherings’ video will be distributed among local radio channels too. The town hall sessions will discuss and respond to question and concerns from the Libyan public, gathered through social media campaigns started at least 5 days before the gathering date. GNA media administration members will also share updates on the social media platform during the sessions. The forum will be organized by a committee of 6 members who are working for the PC/GNA media administration and are experienced in the field of media. Mohamed Alsharkasy is the presenter of the gathering; he is known for his good reputation and neutrality as a TV presenter during his previous work at Al-Assima TV. LTI 2 will provide stipends, venue, logistical support, accommodation and travelling expenses for national participants from South and East.

This activity aims to help provide GNA ministries and institutions with information and tools to better communicate critical GNA updates to the public, including key outcomes of the November London Economic Summit. To achieve this objective, LTI 2 is supporting the PC/GNA media administration to produce and distribute videos about key GNA milestones and updates. Five of the videos will highlight key solutions from the November London Summit to address the Libyan economic crisis, and the other videos will highlight forthcoming critical updates or messages impacting the Libyan public over the next 3 months. GNA officials will lead in content development, while LTI will provide in-kind support for production and distribution. Additionally, LTI 2 will support the GNA media administration and Ministry of Planning to conduct GNA-wide seminar in Tripoli about the outcomes and next steps from the London Economic Summit. It will engage representatives of the concerned ministries, local banks, and governmental institutions, as well as members of the media. The effort will establish a fast-response mechanism to help ministries and offices across the GNA communicate positive updates with the public in a timely fashion.
","
If LTI 2 supports PC/GNA media administration to produce and distribute videos about key milestones and updates and holds a seminar about the outcomes of the London Economic Summit, then GNA ministries and institutions have the information and tools needed to better communicate critical GNA updates to the public.

It assumes that:

• The ministries want to share positive news and messages with the media and public. 

• The GNA media administration will lead the content development process - they simply need in-kind support for production and distribution.

• The GNA media administration will facilitate access to GNA officials for interviews and filming.

• Short videos featuring simple explanations for Libyan leaders distributed on TV and social media is the most effective tool for reaching a large segment of the population. (News agencies are also more likely to report on and show parts of good quality videos.) 

• The seminar will clarify London Economic conference outcomes for the ministries, GNA institutions, and press and provide an opportunity to highlight tangible progress the GNA is making.


",Getting the Message Out: Supporting the GNA to Communicate Progress,"
Since the signing of the Libya Political Agreement (LPA) in late 2015, Libya’s political future is hopeful but fragile. A new Government of National Accord (GNA) is working to help the country recover from two years of violent conflict between regional political factions. Despite strong support from the international community, powerful spoilers – particularly in the East – continue to challenge the GNA. Also, entrenched disdain for national level governance and rapidly eroding quality of life undermines the GNA’s credibility. Meanwhile, municipal councils have assumed significant governance responsibilities over the past 2 years, and they are still viewed as the most credible institutions. However, they face serious challenges in providing services to their constituents and are disconnected from national level counterparts and other local actors. Finally, the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security dysfunction to strengthen its influence.
At the national level, the new GNA is struggling to gain legitimacy and authority, largely because of its weak capacity for public outreach and communications. Meanwhile powerful detractors continue to grow in influence, undermine the GNA, and spread misinformation. Furthermore, successive rounds of polling in Libya have revealed strong disdain for national political institutions and actors, and Libyans are disillusioned with the failure of previous national transitional efforts. In response, LTI 2 is helping the GNA and its proponents at the local level educate people about its mandate, engage ordinary Libyans in the political transition process, and communicate its progress in addressing citizens’ priorities. Specifically, at the national level, LTI 2 is focusing on direct support the Presidency Council in its public outreach and communications efforts – primarily through the PC media office and GNA ministries. 
In May, the GNA ministries received authorization to commence their work, and they started reconstructing their media offices over the summer. At the same time, the presidency council established the GNA Media Administration to coordinate communications on behalf of the presidency council and all ministries and national government departments. Under NAT012, LTI 2 conducted a pilot activity with the GNA Media Administration - a one day seminar involved Media Administration members and Libyan media outlets. These media outlets expressed the need to improve communications and receive more frequent information from the GNA ministries. However the GNA media administration is severely under-resourced and most staff are new, they lack skills, equipment, and systems for effective internal and external communications. This lack of interaction and communication with the public via traditional and social media is one of the greatest challenges to the GNA's performance and legitimacy. Under NAT014, LTI is providing communications and media training and equipment for the Presidency Council Media Administration and GNA ministry media offices to help address this issue. However, the media administration still requires external support in the short-term to get information to the public about critical issues and events. 
Thus, in this activity, LTI 2  is establishing a new grant with the GNA Media Administration that will provide in-kind support (through external production and technical assistance) to produce and distribute videos about key GNA milestones or updates, including the recent London Economic Summit outcomes. In addition, LTI 2 will work with the GNA media administration to conduct a seminar in Tripoli about the London Economic Summit outcomes. The seminar general plan is discussed and approved by the PC and Ministry of Planning. The seminar aims to update the media and the public and address public criticism about issues being discussed and decided outside Libya. The PC/GNA media administration will send invitation letter to invite ministries and governmental institution to present during this seminar; including ministry of planning, Justice, Finance, and Economy, and CBL, NOC, LIA, Libyan Foreign Bank, Local banks, UN office in Libya, World Bank office, and Libya Audi Bureau. In addition, the media administration will invite a number of media outlets to attend and cover the event and hold an official press conference after the event. At the same time, the videos will simplify the Summit outcomes in order to educate the public about the GNA current steps towards the economic issues in Libya. In this activity LTI will cover the video production and distribution costs and will provide venue and catering for the seminar. The PC/ GNA media Administration will be supervising and working along with the ministry of planning in organizing the seminar.

This activity aims to support GNA media administration and municipal council and local media stakeholders in Sirte to improve outreach to Sirte residents and IDPs who have not yet returned and to more effectively communicate the GNA’s role in Sirte recovery efforts. To achieve this objective, LTI 2 will support the GNA media administration's efforts to improve collaboration with Sirte local media outlets, produce and distribute outreach materials, and provide training to Sirte local partners. The GNA media administration will host a series of workshops, (three 7-9 day workshops over a 1 month period) where 25-30 participants from Sirte area, representing media outlets and MC communication staff, will receive advanced training and develop a media plan to inform Sirte residents, returnees and IDPs who have not yet returned about the GNA's efforts to support Sirte recovery. The training will focus on advanced news writing and reporting, conducting interviews with the media, social media outreach, and video production. The media plan will include information participants can share about Sirte rehabilitation efforts and the different media tools they may use (including social media, printed materials, radio, and TV) to disseminate their messages. Due to the unstable situation in Sirte, workshops will take place in Tripoli. The GNA Media Administration will finalize arrangements with Sirte local media outlets and the Sirte Municipal Council media office, as well as providing training and facilitating the workshops. One of the most significant problems plaguing the GNA is its lack of capacity to get information to the public about critical issues and events - particularly for the Sirte liberation and recovery process, in which the GNA has played a major role. This activity will both help the GNA media administration establish coordination with local media and public outreach partners in Sirte area and supplement their short-term capacity to disseminate information about the rehabilitation process.
","
If the GNA media administration provides venue rental, capacity building support, and implementation resources to local media outlets from Sirte and the Sirte municipal council’s media committee, and works with those stakeholders to develop and execute a shared media strategy, THEN GNA media administration will build linkages with Sirte media outlets and local council stakeholders partners and increase awareness among Sirte residents and IDPs about the GNA’s role in Sirte’s recovery BECAUSE:
Assumptions: 
-Sirte local media outlets lack capacity and information about the GNA’s activities to convey information to Sirte residents and IDPs. 
-The GNA media administration lacks the resources to conduct workshops and trainings for MC media staff and Sirte local media outlets. 
-Sirte residents and IDPs are unaware of the GNA’s role in Sirte recovery efforts and lack information about conditions in Sirte and ongoing efforts to restore security and services to the city.
- Sirte MC staff and media outlets are willing to cooperate with the GNA media administration.
- The GNA has failed to effectively communicate its role in Sirte recovery efforts and progress with restoring security and services to the city due to lack of resources and coordination with local stakeholders.

Finally, the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State and other violent extremist groups taking advantage of the governance and security vacuums to strengthen their influence.
At the national level, the GNA is struggling to gain legitimacy and exert its authority, in part because of its limited capacity for public outreach and communications. Meanwhile, powerful detractors continue to grow in influence, undermine the GNA, and spread misinformation. Successive rounds of polling in Libya have revealed strong disdain for national political institutions and actors, and Libyans are disillusioned with the failure of previous national transitional efforts. In response, LTI 2 is helping the GNA and its local level allies educate people about its mandate, engage ordinary Libyans in the political transition process, and communicate its progress in addressing citizens’ priorities. Specifically, at the national level, LTI 2 is providing direct support to the Presidency Council (PC) in its public outreach and communications efforts – primarily through the PC media office and GNA ministries. 
In May, GNA ministries received authorization to commence their work, and they started reconstructing their media offices over the summer. At the same time, the presidency council established the GNA Media Administration to coordinate communications on behalf of the PC, ministries, and national government departments. Under NAT012, LTI 2 conducted a pilot activity with the GNA Media Administration - a one day seminar involving Media Administration members and Libyan media outlets. Media outlets had expressed the need to improve communications and receive more frequent information from the GNA ministries. However, the GNA media administration is severely under-resourced. Most staff are new and lack skills, equipment, and systems necessary for effective internal and external communications. Lack of interaction and communication between the GNA and the public through traditional and social media is a significant challenge to the GNA's performance and legitimacy. Under NAT014, LTI is providing communications and media training and equipment for the Presidency Council Media Administration and GNA ministry media offices to help address this issue. Each national line ministry has its own media office, and the Presidency Council media administration coordinates public information, media outreach, and messaging across all ministry media offices. However, the media administration still requires external support in the short-term to get information to the public about critical issues and events. This issue is particularly acute for the GNA's Sirte liberation and rehabilitation efforts undertaken by the GNA. Since the liberation, coverage has been muted because of the lack of trained interlocutors, coordination with local partners, and a media strategy. Sirte’s Municipal Council – particularly the Mayor Mukhtar Almadanna – has publicly complained that it is receiving inadequate support from the GNA.  Accordingly, the positive role that the GNA is playing in Sirte’s rehabilitation process has not been well communicated with the public, contributing to the perception that the GNA is largely absent from the process.
In this activity, LTI2 will support the GNA Media Administration to increase its communication with Sirte MC, to enhance cooperation with Sirte media outlets, and to improve Sirte MC media staff performance. After the liberation of Sirte from ISIS, it is important to communicate positive messages of progress and general updates to Sirte residents and IDPs who have not yet returned about the situation in Sirte. The project was developed in a meeting held between Jalal Othman, head of GNA Media Administration and Mukhtar Almadany, the MC Mayor of Sirte, during which they discussed the cooperation between the two offices and boosting coordination with local media entities in Sirte. The activity aims to train Municipal Council staff and media office and media stakeholders on advanced communication and public outreach skills and conduct workshops to design a joint media plan that leverages different media tools that target Sirte residents and IDPs who have not yet returned to Sirte. LTI will provide venue rental costs for planning and training workshops, travel and accommodating for Sirte MC and media outlet representatives to attend the workshops, and printing of outreach materials highlighting the GNA’s role in Sirte recovery. The project will strengthen GNA Media Administration’s  cooperation with Sirte MC media office and Sirte local media outlets.

This activity will increase the reach and quality of peace messaging in Southwestern Libya through the establishment of a rapid response fund. Specifically, this fund will support the production and dissemination of peace messaging and campaigns developed to reinforce and strengthen local peace initiatives as they arise. In parallel to interventions that promote dialogue and mitigate conflict, this activity will provide material and logistical to endorse peaceful outcomes to local and regional conflicts. The current wave of inter-tribal fighting, visible lack of state intervention, and political volatility in the south erodes public confidence in the possibility for peace, emboldens militias and tribes, and complicates implementation of key transition milestones. This DDGS will provide a flexible tool to help civil society groups and peace actors be catalysts for change on the ground.

",Strengthening the Foundations for Peace in the South: A Rapid Response Fund,"
""Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust towards government.  
Sabha is located in the southwestern region of Libya and is by many considered the “capital of the south.” With over 150,000 inhabitants, Sabha is a hub for most activities taking place in southwestern Libya and connects surrounding cities such as Ubari, Murzuq and Brak as a vital political and economic focal point.  Most of the trade coming from Niger, Chad and Sub-Saharan country also travels through Sabha and several industries cater to these trade routes. The make-up of the city is mixed between Arabs, Tuaregs and Tebu, which introduces challenges and opportunities. Sabha and surrounding towns such as Ubari and Murzuq have unfortunately seen several deadly clashes the last months. 
The beginning of 2014 was not a good start of the new year in Sabha and the southwest as tribal and political fighting has left over 110 people dead and over 250 wounded. The rise of former pro-Gadhafi loyalist has also scared many in the south, as they have had to defend themselves against militias seeking to overturn the revolution and bring back the Qadhafi family and the parts of the former regime. The grief is further exacerbated as many feel that the central government in Tripoli did little to nothing to stop the violence and help the citizens of Sabha, a city that in the last days of January ran out of most vital items such as food, petrol and medicine. The sense of marginalization is dangerous in a state that struggles to keep its citizens united. This has historically led to frequent outbreaks in violence and conflict. The impact of local pro-dialogue and peace-building voices has been limited in the South – which is why this activity is so critical.
This DDGS will create a flexible fund to respond to local peace initiatives as they arise with reinforcing peace messaging campaigns and products. It will produce and disseminate peace messaging and provide logistic support for civil society groups to disseminate those messages widely. LTI 2 has received requests from organizations in Ubari and Murzuq for assistance with peace messaging and outreach campaigns. This DDGS will create a responsive mechanism and clear process so that LTI 2 can swiftly approve an array of anticipated civil society-led activities to bolster stability in the southwest during a critical period in the Libya’s transition. The activity will help in improve the quality and reach of peace messaging by supporting local initiatives that promote dialogue between communities.""

",Let’s talk! Training and Dialogue Opportunities for Women in Sabha,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones, weak government performance, and active conflict are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. During the summer of 2014, Operations Dignity and Dawn changed the security and political landscape of Libya. The impacts of these local and national conflicts is still uncertain, but undoubtedly, the increase in armed violence has negatively impacted the perception of credible governance and stability throughout the country. 
Chronic instability makes it difficult to implement key transition milestones, undermines the credibility of the government, empowers extremists, and has a chilling effect on civic engagement. In southern Libya, pervasive lawlessness and porous borders, the expansion of extremist influence, and escalating tribal tensions are all significant challenges to local security, legitimate local and regional governance entities, and a successful transition. LTI 2 has identified the Southwest, including towns such as Sabha, Ubari and Murzuq, as a critical area for future transition programming. Sabha is located in the southwestern region of Libya and is by many considered the “capital of the South.” With over 150,000 inhabitants, it is a hub for most activities taking place in southern Libya. Most of the trade coming from Niger, Chad and sub-Saharan countries also travels through Sabha and several industries cater to this trade route. Sabha is home to Arab, Tuareg and Tebu tribes and early 2014 saw several deadly clashes between the different groups, while in late 2014 similar classes have erupted in nearby Ubari. In addition to inter-ethnic tensions, Sabha faces a host of security and governance obstacles as a result of underdevelopment.  The Qadhafi regime did not prioritize the South and residents perceive this practice as continuing today. LTIs presence in Sabha seeks to develop activities and programs that are tailored for Sabha and its unique challenges while also contributing to a larger regional activity pool.  
Women are highlighted as a key players in resolving conflicts and making peace in their communities. Even in situations where women are not resolving conflicts directly, women can alert each other about potential or emerging conflict.  Therefore, LTI 2 is continue working to involve women in peace building and civic engagement activities in Southwestern Libya. Given the potential influence of women over men in their lives (at least behind the scenes), this activity seeks to strengthen women’s informal networks that cross tribal or family boundaries. 
Networks for women civic activists and access to information are restricted by social and cultural norms for women in Sabha. However, women have the potential to play a constructive role in supporting the peaceful tribal co-existence and positive social interaction on the community level. This role is constrained by the limited opportunities they have to access to information and opportunities for networking. This grant aims to increase Sabha women’s access to information and opportunities for social interaction through supporting IT courses and dialogue groups. This builds on SABH002 Supporting Women’s Dialogue and Access to Information in Sabha, as continued support of the grantee’s center will foster a critical platform for women to engage in community peace initiatives.
The following categories will be applied in participants’ selection for the classes. 
* Representing as broadly as possible the neighborhoods in Sabha to ensure a diversity of tribal representation and allow for increased social interaction across tribal lines. 
* Participants will be a member at CSOs or other individual who have shown interest or have a track records of supporting principles of non-violence, dialogue and/or civic responsibilities. 
This activity assumes that the capacity for women in Southwest Libya to independently establish an active network in support of peace is very limited. Therefore this activity will assist the grantee to establish and monitor a communication platform to encourage a constructive communication after grant has ended.

This activity seeks to encourage civil society engagement in local and regional peace initiatives through strengthening the role Sabha Scouts as peace actors. LTI 2 will support the Sabha Scouts to conduct a community peace seminar and peace rally that promotes dialogue, unity, and peaceful coexistence. This support is critical considering the decrease in engagement activists and local organizations have had in dialogue and political awareness campaigns in the South since the outbreak of inter-tribal fighting in 2014. This event coincides with the Scouts’ 61st anniversary celebration. The Scouts are a strong partner for this activity because they have built a trust among the community due to their neutrality and dedication to the civic engagement, and, thus, they can bring together conflicting parties in an effort to promote dialogue and nonviolence.

",Scouting for Peace: Supporting the Sabha Scouts Efforts for Dialogue and Peace,"
Libya’s post-revolution political transition has become derailed amid increasing violence. Voter turnout for legislative elections declined 20 per cent between 2012 and 2014, reflecting growing disaffection at the political process. In the east, Operation Dignity was launched in May 2014 to root out extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all-out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments have formed, in alignment with these precarious alliances. Each side has sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fuelling instability across Libya. This has created a conducive environment for criminals and extremists to recruit and operate. The country faces increasing polarization, including fears that it could split along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.
Instability in Southwest Libya has the potential to destabilize the wider country and its neighbors. Gaddafi imposed a balance of power in the region by manipulating local communities through access to resources. The Southwest was marginalized and denied the dividend of its abundant oil resources. The 2011 revolution swept away the status quo. As a result, local tribes and sub-tribes are competing for territory, international smuggling routes and strategic assets, particularly oil fields. The South’s porous borders have facilitated an influx of weapons, criminals and extremists that have further fed instability. Communal competition has contributed to significant tensions and led to frequent outbreaks of violence: 2014 began with major tribal and political fighting in Sabha between Awlad Suliman and Tebu, which left over 100 dead. It ended with heavy fighting between Tebu and Tuareg in Ubari, resulting in around 250 dead. The Dawn-Dignity conflict has further exacerbated local rivalries, as each side has courted allies among the tribes. Beyond rivalry over resources and territory, there are deeper causes of unrest, such as the marginalization of stateless Tebu and Tuareg, who are denied the rights associated with citizenship.
In the context of this instability, several peace and dialogue initiatives are currently ongoing in the Southwest – many with the involvement of local NGOs and CSOs – in an attempt to resolve tribal and political fighting. These initiatives include peace talks between Tebu and Tuareg, the youth neighborhood dialogue project, a project for citizen activists, and a peace messaging campaign led by a network of CSOs currently supported by LTI 2 under SAB001. The growing interest among local CSOs in promoting local peace initiatives is a crucial opportunity for LTI 2. According to the LTI 2 Governance and Stability Assessment in Southwest Libya (GSA), since the outbreak of inter-tribal fighting in 2014, activists and local organizations have been noticeably less involved in dialogue and political awareness campaigns due to fears of retaliation. One NGO director in Sabha lamented that ""arms in the streets have the upper hand over public life in Sabha,"" expressing the decreased influence of civic activists and CSOs. Even when organizations are involved in mediation activities, they are often perceived to be politicized or exclusive of marginalized communities (per the findings of the GSA conflict assessment in Sabha). Particularly during this period, inclusive, neutral civic organizations need encouragement and support in their efforts to  advocate for dialogue and peaceful coexistence. 
Thus, in this activity, LTI 2 will encourage the Scouts’ role in promoting peace and dialogue in Sabha and building broader public engagement in ongoing local peace initiatives. With LTI 2 support, the Sabha Scouts will use the opportunity of their 61st anniversary celebration to lead a seminar on the role of the Scouts and other civic organizations in promoting peace and principles for nonviolence and dialogue. The Scouts and other groups will present their peace efforts, facilitate discussions on local peace initiatives, and arrange for speeches by Sabha elders, Sabha Scouts representatives, and representatives from other CSOs. The seminar will include representatives from the Youth and Sport council, Tajuma Fazzan, Women's Union in the South, Lawyer’s Coalition, Basmat Shabab for Development and Human Rights, Red Crescent, and Sabha elders. After the seminar, the Scouts will march in a peace rally for 30 minutes along the street near of the Scout’s yard while singing songs about peace and finally meet in the Scouts yard near the seminar venue to light together candles in the shape of peace messages in multiple local languages.
The Scout’s movement was founded in Libya in 1954 and in Sabha in 1955. With approximately 2,000 members in Sabha, the Scouts are known for their voluntary spirit and positive contributions to the Libyan society. In Sabha, the Scouts have conducted awareness campaigns, cultural events, youth skills trainings, and field trips to teach valuable life skills. They have cooperated with the Red Crescent in first aid training and the National Council for Liberty and Rights on workshops for monitoring the HOR elections. Additionally, the Scouts have worked with the Danish Refugee Council to raise awareness of violence against women issues and the danger of arms. Thus, they have been cooperating with national and international organizations, supporting peaceful transition in the south, and helping in crises. For many years, the scouts have built trust among the community and gained respect for their neutrality and dedication to the civic engagement.
This activity will help address the issues noted above that CSOs are currently facing vis-à-vis mediation initiatives, as well as support their role in promoting peace. Furthermore, this activity also helps address the youth role in peacebuilding. According to TIP002- Governance and Stability Assessment-GSA reports on conflict cycles in Sabha and Ubari, the lack of youth engagement in dialogue is a barrier to sustainable peace because tribal elders involved in mediation have little control over their youth and cannot guarantee that rank-and-file fighters will comply with their decisions. One Tebu elder noted that most peacemaking efforts are conducted by old people; however, it is crucial to begin including youth, most of whom are politically polarized. Although this activity includes beneficiaries from all age groups, the Scouts movement in particular is known for its strong youth representation. Finally, by supporting an inclusive organization like the Scouts and their efforts to bring people together for dialogue, this activity indirectly helps address the larger issue of intertribal tension, which the GSA found to be the number one source of instability in Sabha.
This activity assumes that supporting the Scouts' peace seminar and rally will highlight their role in promoting peace and broaden the reach of their efforts to advocate for non-violence and dialogue.

Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.
In this context, the space for social and civic activism, as well as the capacity of activists in the region, is very limited. Moderate voices for nonviolence, dialogue, and peace face significant challenges on multiple fronts. Particulary in Southwest Libya, many of them lack basic skills in advocacy, message development and dissemination, campaigning, social media, and digital communications. Their voices are often overshadowed by a polarized media, biased national political landscape, and frequent communal and tribal conflict. Activists and moderate voices in Libya also find themselves increasingly threatened by violent extremists who seek to suppress messages in support of peace, dialogue, democratic principles, and human rights. In Sabha for example, the LTI 2 Governance and Stability Assessment (GSA) found that NGOs and civil society activists have recently been much less involved in political awareness campaigns for fear of retaliation, as “arms in the streets have the upper hand over public life in Sabha.” Youth activists, civil society actors, and journalists lack the skills and experience to apply themselves in this new operating environment in Libya. Specialist knowhow is required to minimize risks and maximize effectiveness. 
Thus, this activity will support Southern Libya’s civil society, journalists, and youth activists with a training on advocacy and campaigning, as well as digital security. LTI 2 and Social Activism Training Advisor Dalia Haj-Omar (TIP004) will conduct a six-day training in Istanbul targeting approximately 22 journalists, civil society activists, bloggers, and active youth from Southern Libya. Many targeted participants are already active in civic activism, sharing information, and building networks around Libya while using digital technology. The training is modeled after a training LTI implemented in October 2014 (TRIP132), which included a geographically diverse representation of Libyan civil society and digital activists, though no participants from Southern Libya. This particular training will focus for 3 days on advocacy, drawing upon case studies from North Africa and the Middle East. Dalia and one additional advocacy trainer will equip participants with skills in communication technology, social media, building blocks of advocacy, mobilization, information dissemination, and crowdsourcing. The 3-day digital security training led by Frontline Defenders will be a hands-on training to cover digital security while using social media, phishing/hacking, encryption, and secure communication.

This activity will support Tajuma Fezzan to continue regular roundtable discussions and other activities that engage community leaders, CSOs, and political and social activists in dialogue on critical peace and transition issues in the South. In order to accomplish this objective, LTI 2 will support Tajuma Fezzan with secure and stable office space/facilties in Sabha over the next 6 months. Tajuma Fezzan is one of the most active CSOs in the Southwest, and it plays a particularly important role in facilitating local peace initiatives and bringing together various sides for dialogue - most recently between Tebu and Awlad Suliman and between Tebu and Tuareg. Tajuma Fezzan has previously worked with LTI in implementing TRIP039 and TRIP053 – during which they conducted outreach campaigns on the constitutional process and key transition issues through newspapers and workshops.

",Forum for Peace - Supporting Space for Dialogue in the South,"
Libya’s post-revolution political transition has become derailed amid increasing violence. Voter turnout for legislative elections declined 20 per cent between 2012 and 2014, reflecting growing disaffection at the political process. In the east, Operation Dignity was launched in May 2014 to root out extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all-out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments have formed, in alignment with these precarious alliances. Each side has sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fuelling instability across Libya. This has created a conducive environment for criminals and extremists to recruit and operate. The country faces increasing polarization, including fears that it could split along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.
Instability in Southwest Libya has the potential to destabilize the wider country and its neighbors. Gaddafi imposed a balance of power in the region by manipulating local communities through access to resources. The Southwest was marginalized, denied the dividend of its abundant oil resources. The 2011 revolution swept away the status quo. As a result, local tribes and sub-tribes are competing for territory, international smuggling routes and strategic assets, particularly oil fields. The South’s porous borders have facilitated an influx of weapons, criminals and extremists that have further fed instability. Communal competition has contributed to significant tensions and led to frequent outbreaks of violence: 2014 began with major tribal and political fighting in Sabha between Awlad Suliman and Tebu, which left over 100 dead. It ended with heavy fighting between Tebu and Tuareg in Ubari, resulting in around 250 dead. The Dawn-Dignity conflict has further exacerbated local rivalries, as each side has courted allies among the tribes. Beyond rivalry over resources and territory, there are deeper causes of unrest, such as the marginalization of stateless Tebu and Tuareg, who are denied the rights associated with citizenship.
In the context of this instability, several peace initiatives are currently ongoing in the Southwest – many with the involvement of local NGOs and CSOs – in an attempt to resolve tribal and political fighting. This includes peace talks between Tebu and Tuareg, the youth neighborhood dialogue project, the project for citizen activists, and a peace messaging campaign led by a network of CSOs in the Fezzan and currently supported by LTI 2 under SAB001. Thus, there is much interest among local civil society organizations in the region to develop and promote local peace initiatives to end tribal and political fighting.
In order to capitalize on this momentum and activity in the CSO community, in this activity LTI 2 will  support Tajuma Fezzan to continue engaging community leaders, CSOs, and political and social activists in dialogue on key issues related to local peace, political transition, and civic engagement. LTI 2 will provide secure facilities for six months, which Tajuma Fezzan will use to run regular roundtable discussions (a minimum of one per month). These discussions focus on key aspects of the transition in the South and directly link into regional and national dialogue processes and peace initiatives. Moreover, Tajuma Fezzan also regularly opens its doors to other CSOs to improve coordination and advocacy in the South. Other groups, such as the Libya Women’s Union, use the facility to host meetings and trainings.  
Tajuma Fezzan is a well-respectived, collaborative organization that has developed a reach across the South and is able to bring together many people from diverse communities. Through SABH001, LTI provided for Tajumma Fezzan facilities for one year. The establishment of this office and meeting/workshop space for Tajuma Fezza enabled them to engage local CSOs, municipal authorities, and representatives of National Government. For example, ahead of municipal council elections in May 2014, Tajuma Fezzan invited local candidates to present their platforms during a series of meetings and hosted a day-long training for interested candidates focusing on how to manage city services. Tajuma Fezzan has also been very active in supporting the South's engagement in the consitutional process. When the Constitutional Drafting Assembly (CDA) came to Sabha in June 2014, Tajuma Fezzan facilitated a town hall meeting attended by more than 100 people. Even before the CDA townhall in Sabha, Tajuma Fezzan hosted over a dozen roundtables in southern Libya to gather public opinion on the constitution, and they conducted outreach campaigns on the constitutional process through newspapers and workshops under TRIP039 and TRIP053. Most recently, Tajumma Fezzan members have facilitated local peace initiatives between Tebu and Awlad Suliman and Tebu and Tuareq.
LTI 2 assumes that providing stable facilities to Tajamua Fezzan will allow it to continue to serve as a forum for dialogue, reach out to local community and tribal leaders, and support peace and reconciliation at the local level in Southwest Libya.

This activity aims to foster increased support for dialogue and peaceful coexistence among communities in conflict in Southern Libya through creative media. To accomplish this objective, LTI 2 will support Libyan House of Photography to produce and distribute two videos. The first will creatively represent the story of the historic peace treaty signed between Tebu and Tuareg, and the second will be a music video for a peace message rap song developed by a local music group. LTI 2 will work with Libyan House of Photography to implement the activity in the South, a hotspot of inter-tribal and political conflict that has polarized communities and disrupted inter-tribal cooperation. Libyan House of Photography has worked with multiple local organizations to document community activities and events, including LTI 2-supported events like the Sabha Scouts Peace Seminar and the Marathon for Peace in Sabha.

In the context of this instability, several peace initiatives have recently occurred in the Southwest in an attempt to resolve the fighting. For example, some influential stakeholders and tribal leaders in Sabha have participated recently in the broader UN-led peace talks in Geneva. Moreover, following a late January ceasefire, Tebu and Tuareg leaders have been engaged in local and regional peace talks in an attempt to resolve the conflict between these two tribes. Finally, a number of local peace initiatives are emerging in Sabha, including the youth neighborhood dialogue project, the project for citizen activists, and a peace messaging campaign led by a network of CSOs in the Fezzan and currently supported by LTI 2 under SAB001.

The recent break in fighting, as well as the growing momentum supporting local and regional peace, presents an opportunity to develop messages that build grassroots support for peace. Thus, in this activity, LTI 2 will work with Libyan House of Photography to produce to videos sharing messages in support of peace and dialogue. The first film will depict a story invoking the historic peace agreement between Tebu and Tuareg known as “Amidi-Midi,” or “My Friend – My Friend” in the Tuareg language. The second film will be a video clip for Sokrahood rap group in Sabha for their peace song in Arabic, Tebu, and Tuareg languages. LTI 2 will provide necessary equipment and logistical support and support the distribution of the videos.

Libyan House of Photography was established on 2013. It consists of 21 amateur photographers and videographers. They have been involved in documenting many community events and activities, including Alshourouq exhibition in cooperation with Alshourouq national radio, Sabha cultural day with the Culture & Civil Society Office, and the opening ceremony and organizational profile for Basmat Shabab women’s organization (LTI grantee for SABH002 and SAB002).  They have also coordinated with the Danish Council in organizing a peace photography and painting competition highlighting the plight of refugees in South. Libyan house of photography has also participated in international exhibitions, including the photography exhibition in 2014 in Finland, in which they won the first and the second place. Finally, Libyan House of Photography has been a strong informal partner for LTI 2, working with LTI 2 grantees to document the SAB003 Scouts Peace Seminar and SAB007 Marathon for Peace.

This activity will help foster broad, grassroots engagement in and support of efforts to establish peaceful inter-communal coexistence in Sabha. To help achieve this objective, LTI 2 will support Al-Nahda Sports Club in conducting a Marathon for Peace that brings together diverse communities in Sabha in a demonstration of unity and peaceful co-existence. Conflict dynamics in the southwest feed off, and are driven by the national-level political crisis, influenced by power-brokers in Tripoli and Tobroq. Communities in Southwestern Libya find themselves under pressure to pick a side between the Dawn/Dignity divide. These national political dynamics, as well as local intertribal tensions, have created tremendous community-level polarization. Bringing together diverse groups to rally for peace will help to eliminate these conflicts. The activity will occur in Sabha, the political and economic hub of the Fezzan and a hotspot for ethnic and tribal tensions and sporadic waves of inter-communal conflict. Al-Nahda Sports Club in Al-Jadid neighborhood organizes regular sports activities and youth group discussions of topics like the dangers of drugs and weapons. With over 1500 members, the club’s membership draws on all surrounding communities, making it an important space for intertribal interaction through positive activities. Under SABH011, LTI worked with Al-Nahda Club to create a more attractive, positive space for youth, equipping the club with new recreational equipment and supporting it to conduct community sports events. This grant leverages a partnership initiated under LTI.

Thus, LTI 2 will support Al-Nahda Sports Club in Sabha to conduct a Marathon for Peace that brings together diverse groups and neighborhoods in Sabha in a demonstration of unity and support for local and regional peace. LTI 2 is working to ensure the marathon includes participants from all major tribes, including marginalized groups like the Gadhadfa, who have felt particularly isolated and threatened since the revolution. At the same time, the event will include communities from both sides of the Dawn/Dignity divide in the South. Conflict dynamics in the Fezzan are increasingly driven by powerbrokers in Tripoli and Tobruk, and local armed groups are benefiting from the national struggle between Dawn/Misrata and Dignity/Zintan. The marathon is an opportunity to bring the two sides together, and this inclusiveness will reinforce the marathon’s key messaging around peaceful community coexistence and represent a small step forward in healing the polarization that has driven communities to engage in conflict. The activity is also an opportunity to engage youth in peace initiatives. According to the GSA research, the lack of youth engagement in dialogue is a barrier to sustainable peace, and this sports event with Al-Nahda club represents a step forward to address that problem. Finally, LTI 2 will work with Al-Nahda to use the event as an opportunity to reinforce peace messaging LTI 2 is currently supporting through a coalition of 10 CSOs (including al-Nahda) in the Fezzan. Al-Nahda Sports Club is located in Al-Jadid neighborhood of Sabha. Besides various sports activities such as football, the club organizes social events in the evening discussing such topics as the dangers of drugs and weapons. The club’s membership draws on all surrounding tribal communities, making it an important space for intertribal interaction through positive activities. The club has approximately 1,500 members, including approximately 700 youth. During times of tribal conflict, this club serves as a critical space for sustained community cohesion. In coordination with local government authorities and the club’s administration, LTI supported the club to grow its sports programs and expand its work with youth in Sabha under SABH011. Among the sports clubs in Sahba, al-Nahda has the most experience implementing similar events.

Beyond rivalry over resources and territory, there are deeper causes of unrest, such as the marginalization of stateless Tebu and Tuareg, who are denied the rights associated with citizenship.
In the context of this instability, youth - the majority of Libya's population - are particularly vulnerable to aggressive recruitment into militias, messages promoting violence and extremism, polarized media propaganda, and other negative influences. Youth are the fuel of ongoing disagreements and armed conflict among communities in the South, and the LTI 2 GSA research on conflict cycles has discovered that youth have no regard for efforts to resolve the conflict because of their lack of engagement in dialogue and other political processes. Yet, at the same time, youth have played a central role in the revolution and have the potential to be the dynamo of Libya’s transition process through their creativity and energy. Thus, LTI 2 is launching activities in the South that harness this energy from youth in a positive way, engage them in efforts to encourage non-violence and dialogue, and build their role and capacity as leaders in civic and social life. 
Thus, in this activity, LTI 2 aims to launch a campaign under the title ""I am Homeland"" in partnership with the Faculty of Arts student union (known as Cheer Up club) as an avenue for greater engagement with the Sabha University community, one of the most important and identifiable youth constituencies in the city. In April 2015 LTI 2 conducted a study of Sabha University and its faculties to understand campus life, influential leaders on campus, conflict dynamics, and university engagement with the community. This research informed LTI 2's decision to pursue activities with Cheer Up club, identified in a survey of students as the most influential entity on campus. The research also pointed to clear links between the university and the wider community, as the university often sponsors public events and many students are involved in external CSOs. 
This activity with the Cheer Up club will provide the club with some procurement support to enhance their operational and programmatic capacity for the coming year and support their end-of-semester Ana Wattan (I am Homeland) campaign with procurement, printing and logistical assistance. The campaign will mainly engage university students by distributing leaflets, t-shirts, and caps with messages promoting unified national identity and civic activism. LTI 2 will provide limited equipment to the group that will enable the team organize their work and boost their reach. Also, LTI 2 will cover printing costs, a Facebook advertisement, and some refreshments for the launch of the campaign. Cheer Up club will plan the agenda for the launch and organize the campaign, recruiting volunteers from students to distribute the materials in different locations, including the university campus and public spaces in Sabha. The faculty has agreed to provide a venue for the campaign launch and and office for Cheer up group. The Cheer Up team will also produce a video for the campaign to be presented on local TV channels and the Cheer Up club Facebook page to reach a larger audience other than university students. The group also plans to publish in their wall magazine regular updates and reactions to “I am homeland” campaign.
Cheer up group was established recently, in November 2014. It is led by eight active students of different specializations in the Faculty of Arts of Sabha University. Though the group was recently formed, the leadership has managed to demonstrate outstanding activism on campus, particularly activities that have engaged youth from the languages and media departments. During the Spring 2015 Semester, Cheer Up group conducted two activities. First, they developed a magazine wall posted every 3 days in English, French, and Arabic. It includes various topics, including poems and general knowledge. Second, the group hosted a “debate exhibition,” where 25 students participated in debate exercises related to their major research topics. Cheer Up group has an ambitious attitude and is aiming to engage more students in university and community activism. This activity with Cheer Up club is the first for LTI 2 in pursuit of a broader partnership with Cheer Up to engage the Sabha University community.

Libya’s post-revolution political transition has become derailed amid increasing violence. Voter turnout for legislative elections declined 20 percentage points between 2012 and 2014, reflecting growing disaffection at the political process. In the east, Operation Dignity was launched in May 2014 to root out extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all-out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments have formed, in alignment with these precarious alliances. Each side has sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fueling instability across Libya. This has created a conducive environment for criminals and extremists to recruit and operate. The country faces increasing polarization, including fears that it could split along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.

In this context, the space for social and civic activism, as well as the capacity of activists in the region, is very limited. Moderate voices for nonviolence, dialogue, and peace face significant challenges on multiple fronts. Particularly in Southwest Libya, many of them lack basic skills in advocacy, message development and dissemination, campaigning, social media, and digital communications. Their voices are often overshadowed by a polarized media, biased national political landscape, and frequent communal and tribal conflict. Activists and moderate voices in Libya also find themselves increasingly threatened by violent extremists who seek to suppress messages in support of peace, dialogue, democratic principles, and human rights. In Sabha for example, the LTI 2 Governance and Stability Assessment (GSA) found that NGOs and civil society activists have recently been much less involved in political awareness campaigns for fear of retaliation, as “arms in the streets have the upper hand over public life in Sabha.” Youth activists, civil society actors, and journalists lack the skills and experience to apply themselves in this new operating environment in Libya. They have few examples of non-violent civic and community activism in Libya, and examples from similar contexts would be particularly useful to give them models for maximizing their effectiveness. 

Thus, this activity will support 11 of Southern Libya’s most activity civil society organizations throughout the region to conduct a month-long film festival in late June/early July to expose local activists, youth, women, and local leaders to key concepts and examples of civic activism and non-violent movements through a documentary film festival across the region. LTI 2 will provide a small library of films to each civil society organization, in addition to equipment the groups need to host community film screenings. The films focus on non-violent movements and resistance, the use of music and other forms of art for activism, peacebuilding, a satirical examination of the cost of war, women's rights, and transition to democracy, among other themes. Each civil society organization will be responsible for introducing the films and facilitating a discussion and question/answer session following the screenings. Diverse tribes and communities all across the South will be viewing and discussing the same films during this month-long initiative. Target areas include Sabha, Ghat, Aljufra, Wadi Al-shati, Ubari, Katrun, and Murzuq, as well as a few smaller villages outside of these cities. Partners include Tajuma Fezzan, Basmat Shebab, Basir alkhir, Youth for Change, Toumast, Fasania, Libyan House of Photography, Forums Of Ahlamuna, Rabsa, Women's Union of Qatrun, and Sons of the Desert. LTI 2 partners will be responsible for the logistics of implementing and promoting each of the 40 screenings scheduled for different nights during the summer season across the South.

In the east, Operation Dignity was launched in May 2014 to root out extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all-out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments have formed, in alignment with these precarious alliances. Each side has sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fueling instability across Libya. This has created a conducive environment for criminals and extremists to recruit and operate. The country faces increasing polarization, including fears that it could split along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition. 

Meanwhile, instability in Southwest Libya continues. The 2011 revolution fully disrupted the Gaddafi-era balance of power among tribes. As a result, local tribes are competing for territory, international smuggling routes, and strategic assets - particularly oil fields. The South’s porous borders have facilitated an influx of weapons, criminals, and extremists, feeding further instability. 2014 began with major tribal and political fighting in Sabha between Awlad Suliman and Tebu, which left over 100 dead. It ended with heavy fighting between Tebu and Tuareg in Ubari, resulting in around 250 dead. Finally, the national-level Dawn-Dignity conflict has further exacerbated local rivalries, as each side has exploited existing tribal divisions to court allies and polarized most of the South.
Media outlets are not immune to these dynamics. Indeed, many media outlets and journalists in the South have become platforms for one-sided coverage and propaganda that fuels political and tribal divides. GSA media trends analysis research revealed that polarizing media narratives and inflammatory language on television and social media is exacerbating conflicts in the South, particularly between Tebu and Tuareg and between Dawn and Dignity supporters. This violent discourse in the media reinforces negative stereotypes and reduces the ability of communities to compromise and find common ground – contributing to larger issues of polarization in the South. As these conflicts have become more entrenched, media outlets and journalists have felt pressure to align with one side, and the space for balanced media content that counters violent discourse has become very limited. This media polarization has flooded the region with biased information that exacerbates the conflict and feeds public distrust of television channels and social media outlets. 

Thus, in this activity LTI 2 will support Fezzan TV's efforts to develop and deliver content to counter violent discourse and polarization in the media. In July Fezzan TV will host a summer peace campaign, a series of 10 street quiz episodes in Sabha City. The campaign will run for 10 days in July. Each day, Fezzan TV reporters will go onto the streets of Sabha with a different factual question about historical peacebuilding and reconciliation events in similar contexts, and the winner each day will receive a prize. For 5 of the days, the Fezzan TV presenter will share further background on the topic of the question, and LTI 2 will provide Fezzan TV with a brief video clip that further explains the theme. The 5 key themes LTI 2 has identified with Fezzan TV include: reconciliation, inter-tribal conflict resolution, inclusive peacebuilding, the youth role in dialogue, and disarmament and reintegration of fighters into civilian life. Finally, at the end of the Eid al-Fitr holidays, Fezzan TV will bring all the winners together for a televised interview to speak up in support of mediation and dialogue in the South.

In this activity, LTI 2 aims to increase opportunities for public participation in the decision-making processes and functions of Sabha municipal government agencies and institutions. In order to achieve this objective, LTI 2 will support the Sabha Municipal Council to establish, equip, and promote the Sabha Dialogue and Community Center. This neutral and accessible public space will serve as a forum for regular town hall conversations between citizens and representatives of the local government, dialogue and mediation efforts to resolve local crises, and youth and CSO activities. LTI 2 will work directly through the Sabha Municipal Council to provide this support - thereby boosting public confidence in the council's ability to provide public services - While IRI is expected to provide complementary capacity building and mentoring throughout the process.

",Building the People's Government: Sabha Dialogue and Community Center,"
Libya’s post-revolution political transition became derailed in 2014. In the east, Operation Dignity was launched in May 2014 to root out extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all-out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments formed in alignment with these alliances, increasing polarization and raising fears that Libya could split along regional lines. Each side sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fuelling instability across Libya. More recently, conflict fatigue has set it in, prompting popular calls for peace. Stability has increased in many neighborhoods of Benghazi following successes by Operation Dignity while local reconciliation initiatives have proliferated in western Libya. A fragile, UN-sponsored peace agreement was signed by some parties to the conflict in Morocco in July 2015. However, instability persists, particularly between ethnic groups in southern Libya. The Islamic State is making headway in central Libya, capitalizing on the vacuum of authority. Powerful spoilers remain outside of the recent agreements, making the immediate future unclear.
Sabha is the political and economic hub of Southwest Libya - a region where tribal conflict, porous borders, and the lack of governance and public security have the potential to destabilize Libya and its neighbors. Gaddafi imposed a balance of power in the region by manipulating local communities through access to resources. The 2011 revolution swept away the status quo and disrupted the precarious balance of power between Southern tribes, who are now competing for territory, international smuggling routes, and strategic assets, particularly oil fields. The South’s porous borders have facilitated an influx of weapons, criminals, and extremists that have further fed instability. In Sabha, communal competition has contributed to significant tensions and led to frequent outbreaks of violence: 2014 began with major fighting in Sabha involving Awlad Suliman, Tebu, and Gadhafa tribes, which left over 100 dead. Sporadic tribal clashes continue, particularly in the neighborhoods of Tayouri, Nasria, Mahdiyya, and Manshiya, and the Third Force presence provides a tenuous stability. The Dawn-Dignity conflict has further exacerbated local rivalries, as each side has courted allies among the tribes. While tribal tensions have destabilized the South and political divisions have crippled national-level governing institutions, municipal councils in Sabha and other towns have become more relevant for Libya's democratic transition and have continued to function. Under the process of devolution to Libyan municipalities, Sabha successfully held local elections for the 7-member municipal council in August 2014. The GSA research found that, despite the dominance of Awlad Suleyman on the body, public perceptions of the council are generally positive, and it has played a role in local mediation efforts. Responding to a window of opportunity to strengthen municipal governance in Sabha and other towns across Libya, LTI 2 formed a partnership with the International Republican Institute (IRI) in 2015 to provide complementary support to 8 key municipal councils, including Sabha. While LTI 2 provides community investments to help the councils deliver public services, IRI offers practical training to councils in the process of these community projects. As a part of this programming cluster, this grant will support the Sabha Municipal Council to establish, equip, and promote the Sabha Dialogue and Community Center, with the aim of increasing opportunities for public participation in the decision-making processes and functions of Sabha municipal government agencies and institutions. The council proposed this idea to LTI 2 in response to demands from CSOs for a neutral, accessible center to communicate with local officials. This public space will serve as a forum for regular town hall conversations between citizens and representatives of the local government - for example, members of the municipal council, education officials, and local commissioners responsible for public services. The center will also provide a space for civil society and youth activities, workshops, and dialogue and mediation efforts to resolve local crises. The Municipal Council in cooperation with the Ministry of Education is providing a permanent building with a large meeting space and offices. LTI 2 will assist in some light rehabilitation and equipping of the facility. LTI 2 is also supporting a media campaign to inform citizens of the new center and will assist in initial staffing and establishing the center's independent board.

The grant will support the installation of one playground set in Sabha  and a campaign to promote the work of the municipal council and encourage greater community engagement. The objective of this effort is to strengthen the credibility of local municipal government among the public by assisting it in providing tangible community engagement project and developing interaction opportunities. In addition to boosting government legitimacy, the activity will create space for greater inter-group contact and help strengthen social trust, which has been weakened as a result of the decades of Gadhafi rule and subsequent political conflict. In this program cluster, LTI2 will directly partner with the Sabha municipal council, while IRI will provide complementary capacity building and mentoring throughout the process.

These activities assume that the ability of municipal councils to mobilize local residents and deliver highly visible community-engagement projects would strengthen their legitimacy among citizens and enable them to play more vital role in the governance process at the local level.

Libya’s post-revolution political transition became derailed in 2014.

In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments formed in alignment with these alliances, increasing polarization and raising fears that Libya could split along regional lines. Each side sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fueling instability across Libya. More recently, conflict fatigue has set it in, prompting popular calls for peace. Warring Libyan factions signed UN-brokered peace agreement in Morocco in December 2015, but powerful spoilers remain outside of the agreement, making the immediate future unclear.



Following the bifurcation of Libya’s national legislative and executive branches in 2014, the country’s municipal councils, established a year earlier, remain as its most legitimate democratic authority. According to LTI-sponsored research under TRIP134 in Tripoli, 72 per cent of respondents perceived the councils as having a great deal or fair amount of legitimacy, significantly higher than either of the national legislatures. Independent research conducted by other international organizations show similar results across Libya. However, following the slowdown and eventual halt in the disbursal of national revenues as a result of the conflict, the municipal councils currently lack resources to exercise their authority and establish credibility among their constituents. The TRIP134 survey recorded that only 1 per cent of respondents perceived the councils to wield the most authority in Libya’s capital. Bridging the yawning gap between the legitimacy and authority of the municipal councils will help to establish the citizen-state relationship and invigorate waning public support for Libya’s democratic transition.



With intention to support this process, LTI2 is assisting municipal councils in 12 towns across Libya in implementing tangible community engagement projects - the multi-functional playgrounds for children and youth - to encourage greater social interaction in local communities and build public confidence in local government's ability to deliver services. By bringing together local authorities, civil society, and community members to deliver practical projects, these activities aim to build relationships among key stakeholders and bolster the visibility and legitimacy of municipal councils in their areas. As a part of this programming cluster, LTI2 formed partnership with International Republican Institute (IRI) to identify and support complementary activities to assist municipal councils in pursuing effective public outreach campaigns. The activities are designed with the goal to support the joint community investment, but also encourage greater public participation and transparency in decision-making.



In this activity, LTI2 will support the installation of a community playground in Sabha and an accompanying public outreach campaign. Sabha is the political and economic hub of Southwest Libya - a region where tribal conflict, porous borders, influx of extremists, and the lack of governance and public security have the potential to destabilize Libya and its neighbors. While tribal tensions have weakened the South, municipal council in Sabha has become more relevant and has continued to function despite the crisis of the national government institutions. The GSA research found that public perceptions of the council are generally positive, in part owing to its active role in mediating local conflicts. Under SAB011, LTI2 supported the Sabha council with the establishment and promotion of the Dialogue and Community Center, which serves as forum for regular town hall conversations between citizens and representatives of the local government. 



This activity will build on the early success of SAB011 and further assist the council with a tangible community improvement project and a public outreach campaign. Following the installation of the playground, LTI2 and IRI will collaborate with the council to organize a one-day event featuring popular activities for children and a press event to enable the council to address the residents and media and showcase its activities. The event will be organized in partnership with the Sabha Dialogue and Community Center.

In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious.

More recently, conflict fatigue has set it in, prompting popular calls for peace. Warring Libyan factions signed UN-brokered peace agreement in Morocco in December 2015, but powerful spoilers remain outside of the agreement, making the immediate future unclear.
Since the revolution, Libyans have stressed that a decline in community engagement and the lack of social spaces have been among the key factors preventing trust building and the nation from moving forward. Qaddafi did not allow for many social spaces for most of his rule and Libya has never been a nation, with communities divided before and during colonialism, a weak functioning state under the kingdom and divide-and-rule tactics under Qaddafi. The post-revolution inter-communal conflict only exacerbated the already low level of social trust, further threatening the peace and reconciliation efforts. Particularly at this key time in the building of the Libyan nation, people will need to come together in order to forge a common national identity. In addition to strengthening the Government of National Accord and local municipal councils, increasing social spaces for interaction and gatherings in priority communities are seen as an important contribution to the nation-building process.
In an effort to counter the sense of frayed social cohesion, LTI is implementing a cluster of visible, tangible community engagement projects that help to boost support for the local actors, including municipal councils and active civil society organizations, and create space for inter-communal interaction. As a part of this programming cluster in the South, LTI2 will partner with the Jufrah-based Youth for Change organization and support the installation of a multifunctional playground for children and youth and an event to bring the residents and children together for a day of fun and engaging activities. The activity will be supported by Jufrah municipal council and designed to support joint community investment and encourage greater public engagement. 
Jufrah is one of the key towns in the Southwest Libya - a region where tribal conflict, porous borders, influx of extremists, and the lack of governance and public security have the potential to destabilize Libya and its neighbors. While tribal tensions have weakened the South, local actors - such as civil society organizations and municipal councils across the region  - have become more relevant and have continued to function despite the crisis of the national government institutions. The research conducted by LTI and other organizations found that public perceptions of the councils and CSOs are generally positive, in part owing to their active role in civil engagement and reconciliation efforts. Youth for Change is one of the pioneer CSOs in the South and actively participated in or supported a number of LTI’s activities, including the popular SAB009 South Summer Film Festival on Non-Violent Social Change.
The key assumption behind this activity is that community spaces and engaging events would provide positive opportunities and encourage greater interaction between different communities, thereby helping to restore a sense of social trust and cohesion.

Each side sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fueling instability across Libya. More recently, conflict fatigue has set it in, prompting popular calls for peace. Stability has increased in many neighborhoods of Benghazi following successes by Operation Dignity, while local reconciliation initiatives have proliferated in western Libya. However, instability persists, particularly between ethnic groups in Southern Libya. The Islamic State is making headway in central Libya, capitalizing on the vacuum of authority. Powerful spoilers remain outside of the recent agreements, making the immediate future unclear.



Under the UNSMIL-led Libyan Political Dialogue, some parties to the conflict agreed to the core text of a fragile peace agreement in July 2015 in Morocco, and on October 9 the UN Special Envoy for Libya announced a unity government with proposed candidates for Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Ministers. On December 17, representatives from both sides signed the final agreement in Morocco. UNSMIL and the new GNA is currently working to rally a critical mass in Libya to support the agreement, but neither the Tripoli-based GNC nor the internally-recognized HOR in Tobruk have backed it yet. Meanwhile, Libyan-led efforts to forge an alternative agreement have emerged, and powerful spoilers on both sides remain opposed to all agreements, making the immediate future unclear. 

Given the present fragility of the new unity government and the need to rally public support in favor of the political agreement, LTI 2 is continuing a national campaign under the banner of ""let's agree now - on our united future"" in collaboration with influential Libyan CSOs. As we enter into this second, GNA formation phase of the campaign, LTI 2 aims to continue to increase active public support for the UNSMIL Libyan political agreement and formation of a Government of National Accord. In addition, LTI 2 will begin to educate the public about and buttress the legitimacy of the new GNA and its immediate priorities. After the GNA is functioning, LTI 2 will enter a 3rd campaign phase to establish the role of the citizen and inspire shared responsibility for the GNA's success. 

In Southern Libya, in-person discussion, town hall meetings, and public events are the most effective form of communication. Moreover, the South has historically battled marginalization and neglect from Tripoli-based authorities. Thus, under the broader second phase of the campaign, LTI 2 is launching a regionally-tailored effort to educate the public and increase Southern support for the GNA. Local partners will organize a series of public events in towns throughout the South, led and/or facilitated by credible local voices and dialogue representatives. 

This activity with al-Nahda Club will serve as the launch event for the Fezzan specific Phase 2 campaign. LTI 2 will support al-Nahda club to organize the Marathon for National Unity in Sabha. An estimated 250-300 athletes from various tribes and towns in the Fezzan will participate in the race as a demonstration of support the agreement and new GNA. The event will bring together divided communities in the South that have served as regional proxies in the broader Dawn-Dignity conflict. In addition, key regional activists, Municipal Council leaders, and UNSMIL dialogue representatives will speak at the post-marathon ceremony and promote the series of town hall and local public events to unfold in the month following the marathon. In coordination with the Sabha Dialogue and Community Center, LTI 2 will identify and engage all of activists. This effort is intended to rally grassroots support in the South for the GNA and create buzz around the public education campaign throughout the South. SAB015 will serve as the vehicle for the follow-up events, complementing the SAB014 National Unity Marathon.

Al-Nahda Sports Club is located in Al-Jadid neighborhood of Sabha. Besides various sports activities such as football, the club organizes social events in the evening discussing such topics as the dangers of drugs and weapons. The club’s membership draws on all surrounding tribal communities, making it an important space for intertribal interaction through positive activities. The club has approximately 1,500 members, including approximately 700 youth. During times of tribal conflict, this club serves as a critical space for sustained community cohesion. In coordination with local government authorities and the club’s administration, LTI supported the club to grow its sports programs and expand its work with youth in Sabha under SABH011. Among the sports clubs in Sahba, al-Nahda has the most experience implementing similar events.

In this activity, LTI 2 aims to increase understanding of the structure and roles and responsibilities of the Government of National Accord. Specifically, LTI 2 is supporting a network of civil society organizations, community leaders, and activists to educate the public and increase Southern support for the GNA. To accomplish this objective, LTI 2 will support town hall events in five Southern cities of Ubari, Sabha, Jufra, Wadi Al-Shati, and Ghat. LTI 2 will also provide support to hold public distribution events to distribute printed materials to highlight the economic and social cost of the conflict and key information about the Government of National Accord in the areas of Sabha, Jufra, Wadi Al-Shati, Ghat, Ubari, and Murzuq. All events are coordinated through the Sabha Municipal Council Center and local partners. The events will bring together key regional activists, Municipal Council leaders, and ordinary citizens to increase understanding of the nature, form and responsibilities of the national unity government.

This activity assumes that by holding town meetings and distributing printed materials, LTI 2 will help increase understanding about the GNA because:
- People in the South tend to trust information coming from in-person interaction and print media more than from social media or TV AND 
- Trusted community leaders and civil society organizations such as Fezzan Initiative for Reconciliation, Sabha MC Center, Sabha University, and Fassania Newspaper will be involved in presenting and distributing the information AND
- The events will target the largest towns in the South, with media coverage
",Fezzan GNA Town Hall Events and Materials,"
At the beginning of 2016, Libya’s political future is more uncertain than at any time since the 2011 revolution. Political division, armed conflict and a crisis of legitimacy at the national level have accelerated the fragmentation of Libya’s governance landscape. Regional coalitions which formed in 2014 have fractured during 2015 and cities and municipalities have become increasingly isolated. Libya’s two nominal national governments both exert little authority outside their respective bases in Tripoli and Tobruk. The political elites involved in the UN-sponsored dialogue to form a unity government lack legitimacy and the country lacks a national political leadership that can claim a mandate to negotiate a solution to Libya’s crises. The collapse of the national-level political process and institutions has shifted significant governance responsibilities to local formal and informal actors. Municipal councils are viewed as the most credible institutions, though they face serious challenges to providing services to their constituents. The collapse of state institutions and the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security vacuum to strengthen its presence in Libya.

After over a year of dialogue, representatives from various political factions signed the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) in Morocco in late 2015. The new Government of National Accord is (GNA) is currently working to rally support for the agreement and establish its authority and legitimacy in country. A critical mass of support is beginning to grow, particularly from the general public and many municipal councils, but powerful spoilers on both sides remain opposed to the agreement. Furthermore, successive rounds of polling in Libya throughout 2015 have revealed an increasingly strong disdain for national political institutions and actors, and Libyans are disillusioned with the failure of previous transitional efforts at the national level. Given the present fragility of the new GNA and the need to rally public support in favor of the political agreement, LTI 2 is partnering with influential Libyan CSOs and media outlets to increase active public support for the GNA. In addition, LTI 2 is educating the public about the political agreement and the GNA's immediate priorities.

In Southern Libya, in-person discussion, town hall meetings, and printed information are the most effective forms of communication based on LTI research conducted under the Governance and Stability Assessment with Altai. Thus, LTI 2 is supporting a regionally-tailored effort to educate the public and increase Southern support for the GNA. In late January, LTI 2 launched the effort through a marathon and public rally in partnership with the Sabha Municipal Council, the Municipal Council Center, and Sabha's main sports clubs. Since then, some community groups in Sabha and Jufra have held small discussions on the the agreement and the GNA. In this activity, LTI 2 is scaling up the initiative by working with credible, trusted community leaders and CSOs to conduct town hall meetings about the Libyan Political Agreement and GNA. The sessions will occur in Jufra, Sabha, Ubari, Wadi al-Shati, and Ghat in coordination with the municipal councils in each town and civil society organizations such as the Fezzan Initiative for Reconciliation, Fassania, Rabsa, Forum of Academics, and Coalition of Lawyers. LTI 2 will also work with the same organizations to distribute printed materials in the same towns, plus Murzuq, in public squares and parks, main streets, cafes, markets, bread lines and schools (similar to distribution under SAB001).

Late in 2015, the rival tribes signed a peace deal in Doha, paving the way for thousands of displaced Ubari residents to return to their homes. Over the past year, Ubari Municipal Council has made significant efforts to play a key role in building relationship and delivering services to those in need . This activity will enable Ubari MC to discus urgent priorities and create further opportunities for positive relationship with residence through public listening sessions, and recovery plan.

This activity assumes that by holding listening sessions and dialogue/planning meetings about urgent recovery priorities involving the Municipal Council, Elders Council, local civil society groups, and residents, LTI 2 will establish a positive relationship between the MC and residents because:
- recovery and cleanup efforts are the most highly visible and important task for the city right now AND 
- Many residents have been absent for Ubari for a long time and do not know anything about the MC or its role AND
- If the MC is in front of these efforts it will help the MC establish credibility and a connection with residents from the beginning while Elders Council, local civil society groups and trusted actors in Ubari can help reinforce the MC’s role
",Ubari MC Recovery Dialogues,"
At the beginning of 2016, Libya’s political future is more uncertain than at any time since the 2011 revolution. Political division, armed conflict and a crisis of legitimacy at the national level have accelerated the fragmentation of Libya’s governance landscape. Regional coalitions which formed in 2014 have fractured during 2015 and cities and municipalities have become increasingly isolated. Libya’s two nominal national governments both exert little authority outside their respective bases in Tripoli and Tobruk. The political elites involved in the UN-sponsored dialogue to form a unity government lack legitimacy and the country lacks a national political leadership that can claim a mandate to negotiate a solution to Libya’s crises. The collapse of the national-level political process and institutions has shifted significant governance responsibilities to local formal and informal actors. Municipal councils are viewed as the most credible institutions, though they face serious challenges to providing services to their constituents. The collapse of state institutions and the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security vacuum to strengthen its presence in Libya.
In light of the political conflict and dysfunction plaguing the national level since 2014, the country’s municipal councils, established a year earlier, remain Libya's most legitimate democratic authority. According to LTI 2-sponsored research with Altai, a wide majority of Libyans have a positive perception of the role of the municipal councils. In Tripoli specifically, LTI 2 found in 2015 that 72 per cent of respondents perceived the councils as having a great deal or fair amount of legitimacy, significantly higher than any national institution. However, given problems in the disbursal of national revenues as a result of the conflict in Libya, the municipal councils currently lack resources to exercise their authority, communicate effectively, and establish credibility among their constituents. This is leading to decreasing confidence in MCs, after an initial wave of hope that the country finally had some form of responsive governance. Thus, with the goal of increasing confidence in local governance, LTI 2 is assisting several key municipal councils across Libya to better provide basic services and engage with residents, the two main drivers of trust based on our research findings. 
In Ubari, protracted conflict erupted between Tebu and Tuareg tribes in August 2014. Though a dispute over the the operation of gas supply and fuel smuggling was the immediate cause, the conflict was rooted in a much deeper rivalry between the two tribes that emerged after the February 17 Revolution shifted tribal power relations in the Fezzan. In late 2015, the rival tribes signed a peace deal in Doha, paving the way for thousands of displaced Ubari residents to return to their homes. The return and recovery is a significant window of opportunity for the Ubari municipal council, which was elected shortly before the conflict began. Due to the fighting and displacement, the MC has yet to establish a relationship with residents or stand up any service delivery efforts. However, with the stabilization of Ubari, the MC and Mayor Taher Milad is interested to play a key role in recovery efforts to support the return to normal life. In the past month, the mayor has traveled to Tunis seeking support from international organizations and to Tripoli to meet with the Presidency Council. The recovery effort represents a key opportunity for returning residents to engage with the MC, help it prioritize immediate needs, and build confidence with the community by providing some tangible projects. 
Thus, in this activity LTI 2 will support Ubari MC Members, Elder Council and civil society leaders to discuss and form a plan for urgent priorities in Ubari based on listening session feedback with residents. First, LTI will provide support for holding 2-3 listening sessions in Ubari Center. The sessions are open to the public to discuss urgent priorities for Ubari recovery. These listening sessions will culminate in a 1-day public dialogue session involving  MC officials, the Elders Council, and leaders of active youth and civil society organizations. The purpose of the dialogue will be to prioritize and organize recovery efforts in Ubari Center. LTI will provide direct support to Toumast, a long time LTI partner in Ubari, who will manage event promotion, logistics, and follow up. The grantee will collaborate closely with the Ubari MC to ensure the municipal council is publicly in the lead of this effort. Finally, LTI will fund a small priority activity based on the outcomes of the sessions to build confidence in the MC and this public engagement process.

The awareness campaign will include distribution of outreach material in schools, clinics, and main streets across the city to inform public about the mutual collaboration between the national level government and the MC, as well as the effort that MC is making to deliver services for people.
","
If Sabha Municipal Council installs speed bumps and traffic signs in school zones and in front of public clinics AND organize a strong media and public outreach campaign, then we will increase awareness of the Sabha Municipal Council’s efforts to address critical public needs in cooperation with relevant ministries.

Assumptions:

- Citizens currently lack information about MC and ministries cooperation efforts in addressing needs.

- Traffic safety upgrades are a critical public need. Residents have raised concerns about it to school/education officials and hospital leaders, who passed on the concerns to the MC. The upgrades will clearly signal the MC's work to address public safety.

- The Sabha MC wants to deliver services to their community, but lacks the  resources to do so.

- The rehabilitation of schools zones and crosswalks in front of clinics is a highly visible, tangible project that all residents will recognize and appreciate as project completed by the MC.

- The awareness and information campaign will give  the MC an opportunity to connect directly with residents effectively.

- Sabha MC will have strong coordination with ministry involvement from the beginning of the project and will communicate this to citizens through the information  campaign.

Since the signing of the Libya Political Agreement (LPA) in late 2015, Libya’s political future is hopeful but fragile. A new Government of National Accord (GNA) is working to help the country recover from two years of violent conflict between regional political factions. Despite strong support from the international community, powerful spoilers – particularly in the East – continue to challenge the GNA. Also, entrenched disdain for national level governance and rapidly eroding quality of life undermines the GNA’s credibility. Meanwhile, municipal councils have assumed significant governance responsibilities over the past 2 years, and they are still viewed as the most credible institutions. However, they face serious challenges in providing services to their constituents and are disconnected from national level counterparts and other local actors. Finally, the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security dysfunction to strengthen its influence.
At the local level, municipal councils have tried to fill the gap left by absent national governance since 2014, and they remain Libya's most legitimate and functional democratic bodies. According to recent LTI 2-sponsored research, 55% of Libyans view municipal councils as legitimate. Yet, that legitimacy is eroding, as most MCs lack the resources to provide basic services and are detached from both national institutions, other local governance actors, and constituents. In response, LTI is supporting MCs and their partners to bolster the two critical pillars of effective local governance – basic service delivery and public outreach and communications. According to LTI 2 research, these are the two factors most correlated with public confidence in local governance. As a part of these activities, LTI 2 is facilitating relationships between national ministries and local actors to strengthen the long term institutional channels for the flow of resources and technical capacity to the local level. In addition, under the “Our Shared Responsibility” campaign, LTI 2 is helping MCs build a collaborative, participatory approach to governance involving civil society, tribal leaders, neighborhood councils, national representatives, and constituents. Where MC leadership is unsettled, LTI 2 is working more closely with community level actors to strengthen participatory governance and basic services. This includes CSOs, neighborhood councils, and ministry representatives, where possible.

Sabha is the political and economic hub of Southwest Libya - a region where tribal conflict, porous borders, and the lack of governance and public security have contributed to instability in Libya since the revolution. Communal competition has contributed to significant tensions and led to frequent outbreaks of violence involving Awlad Suliman, Tebu, and Gadhafa tribes. Still, the municipal council in Sabha has continued to function with relative legitimacy. Under the process of devolution to Libyan municipalities, Sabha successfully held local elections for the 7-member municipal council in August 2014. Nevertheless, according to LTI 2 research from May 2016, 75% of residents are not satisfied with the service delivery in Sabha - which has a strong impact on perceptions of the MC's legitimacy.In this activity, LTI 2 will provide Sabha MC with in-kind support to address a highly visible public problem - speeding and traffic accidents in areas where a lot of people - especially children and elderly - are walking. Sabha is the political and economic hub of Southwest Libya, people have low confidence in the Sabha MC's ability to provide basic services and support public safety. LTI will help the MC to install speed bumps and traffic signs on the roads in front of 10-15 local schools and 3 public clinics. Also, LTI 2 will support the MC to deliver an outreach campaign to raise public awareness in close cooperation  with the Traffic Police  (Ministry of Interior), Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Health, the support will also include designing and printing flyers and billboards to educate people about the project. This activity will be an opportunity for Sabha MC to provide some basic services related to the resident’s safety and to inform public about the mutual collaboration between the national level government and the MC which will strengthen residents’ confidence in the MC.

Ubari in Southern Libya is recovering from nearly 2 years of tribal conflict and displacement of its residents. In late 2015 rival tribes signed a peace deal, paving the way for thousands of displaced Ubari residents to return to their homes this year. The return and recovery is a significant window of opportunity for the Ubari municipal council, which was elected shortly before the conflict began. Due to the fighting and displacement, the MC is just beginning to establish a relationship with residents or stand up any service delivery efforts. However, with the stabilization of Ubari, the MC and Mayor Taher Milad is interested to play a key role in recovery efforts to support the return to normal life. MC members have traveled to Tunis and Tripoli multiple times seeking support from the Presidency Council. In July, LTI 2 supported the Ubari MC to lead listening sessions in the 3 largest neighborhoods in central Ubari, followed by a planning session with key ministry representatives, elders council, crisis committee, and civil society leaders. Based on public feedback, the top priorities were: (1) cleanup of central Ubari and re-starting public sanitation services; (2) rehabilitating water supply, and (3) rehabilitation of public schools. Following the outcomes, LTI 2 agreed with Ubari MC and the General Water Company to provide support for rehabilitating the water supply - the most responsive and feasible option of the 3 public priorities. Additionally, a UNDP stabilization facility assessment of Ubari in August highlighted the water supply as an urgent recovery priority. 
In this activity LTI 2 will help the Ubari MC respond to the demands raised in these public consultations by providing and installing generators and voltage regulators for three of the five main water wells that supply the water network in Ubari. There are 5 main water wells in central Ubari that require support. This is a critical need in Ubari because of the consistent lack of electricity in the city. During electricity cuts, water pumps do not function, and residents cannot access water. Because of the high costs in the market across Libya, LTI 2 has agreed with the MC to start with the 3 most critical sites at this time. The 3 sites have been identified by the General Water Company, and the supporting the 3 sites will improve the entire interconnected water system. The Ubari MC and neighborhood councils are providing ongoing fuel/maintenance and ensuring site security. In addition, LTI 2 will work with the MC, local elders council, and the neighborhood councils to conduct opening ceremonies and public outreach highlighting the Ubari MC’s response to the public demands identified in public consultations and its efforts to start rehabilitating the water network in coordination with the General Water Company.

This activity aims to increase Mahdiyya and Jadid residents’ awareness of the MC’s efforts to address critical public needs in cooperation with relevant national level authorities. In order to achieve this objective, LTI 2 will provide Sabha MC with support to replace sewage pumps in these two neighborhoods in cooperation with the Public Water and Sewage Company. In addition, LTI will work with the partners to organize a public outreach and information campaign using video, social media, billboards, and a public event or press conference under the ""Our Shared Responsibility"" campaign. The wastewater and sewage flooding in Mahdiyya and Jadid areas of central Sabha is a highly visible public problem, which has been widely covered in the news in the past 2 months. Mahdiyya sewage station covers an estimated 60,000 residents, while Jadid station covers an estimated 35,000, and both stations require new pumps to resolve the issue. The Public Water and Sewage Company is a independent national level utility authority with a branch in Sabha. The Sabha MC is the democratically-elected local governing body, and is working to increase confidence in its legitimacy among residents.

Recently, Sabha is suffering from long power cuts and that’s affecting the delivering basic services (water supply, fuel, hospitals, etc ). When the power is out, there is no electricity to run the water pumps and residents are not able to get water because there is no water in the system. Group of residents, large extended families, or neighborhoods must pool their funds and hire a water truck to go to farms outside of the city with privately operated wells/water pumps.

This activity aims to strengthen Brak residents' awareness of the MC's efforts to address critical public needs in cooperation with relevant national level authorities. In order to achieve this objective, LTI 2 will help Brak Ashati MC to rehabilitate the municipal water system by providing 5 water pumps and one generator at key distribution sites throughout the city. Also, LTI 2 will work with the MC to conduct a strong public awareness campaign. The MC and the neighborhood councils will conduct an opening ceremony and public outreach under Our Shared Responsibility highlighting the Brack MC’s response to the public demands in coordination with the General Water Company. The distribution sites are spread out over 4 different neighborhoods - Afia, Zawia, Bo Gardeka, and Central. The problem of water service delivery in Brak Ashati and the South is a critical service delivery gap impacting all residents. This activity will contribute to great confidence among residents in the municipal council, its national level counterparts, and the participatory basic service delivery process.

",Brak Ashati Water Resource Recovery,"
Since the signing of the Libya Political Agreement (LPA) in late 2015, Libya’s political future is hopeful but fragile. A new Government of National Accord (GNA) is working to help the country recover from two years of violent conflict between regional political factions. Despite strong support from the international community, powerful spoilers – particularly in the East – continue to challenge the GNA. Also, entrenched disdain for national level governance and rapidly eroding quality of life undermines the GNA’s credibility. Meanwhile, municipal councils have assumed significant governance responsibilities over the past 2 years, and they are still viewed as the most credible institutions. However, they face serious challenges in providing services to their constituents and are disconnected from national level counterparts and other local actors. Finally, the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security dysfunction to strengthen its influence.
At the local level, municipal councils have tried to fill the gap left by absent national governance since 2014, and they remain Libya's most legitimate and functional democratic bodies. According to recent LTI2-sponsored research, 55% of Libyans view municipal councils as legitimate. Yet, that legitimacy is eroding, as most MCs lack the resources to provide basic services and are detached from both national institutions, other local governance actors, and constituents. In response, LTI is supporting MCs and their partners to bolster the two critical pillars of effective local governance – basic service delivery and public outreach and communications. According to LTI 2 research, these are the two factors most correlated with public confidence in local governance. As a part of these activities, LTI 2 is facilitating relationships between national ministries and local actors to strengthen the long term institutional channels for the flow of resources and technical capacity to the local level. In addition, under the “Our Shared Responsibility” campaign, LTI 2 is helping MCs build a collaborative, participatory approach to governance involving civil society, tribal leaders, neighborhood councils, national representatives, and constituents. Where MC leadership is unsettled, LTI 2 is working more closely with community level actors to strengthen participatory governance and basic services. This includes CSOs, neighborhood councils, and ministry representatives, where possible.
Brack Ashati MC in Southern Libya is working to establish a relationship with residents by standing up any service delivery efforts. MC members have traveled to Tripoli multiple times seeking support from the national government level. After Sabha, Brack Ashati has absorbed more IDPs from any other town in the South, because Brak Ashati is a relatively peaceful area. It has absorbed nearly 30,000 IDPs - increasing from 70,000 to 100,000 residents in the area. But that’s make pressure on the basic services like water networks and waste water process. The water network in Brack Ashati is basic comparing with Sebha water network, so it couldn’t to take pressure anymore, and the 5 water pumps are stop working or working with bad service. Based Brack Ashati MC discussion with residents the top priorities in the town are: (1) Provide 4 - 6 water pumps to improve water network (2) Provide 2 Generators for two water walls which it's suffering from power cut (3) Provide Chairs and White boards for two schools .(4) Maintenance Tripoli roads from holes, because its cause many accidents for passengers, (5) Create Community Center at MC office for citizens to share the ideas to improve public service. 
In this activity, LTI 2 agreed with Brack Ashati MC and the General Water Company to provide support for rehabilitating the water supply - the most responsive and feasible option of the 5 public priorities. The MC will install 5 water pumps in key neighborhoods and one generator for the central distribution station to help support the entire water network in Brack Ashati. They target neighborhoods are Afia, Zawia, Bo Gardeka, and Central, where the MC will install 2 pumps and the generator. LTI 2 will also support the MC and the neighborhood councils to conduct opening ceremony and public outreach highlighting the Brack Ashati MC’s response to the public demands identified MC and its efforts to start rehabilitating the water network in coordination with the General Water Company.  The activity will allow MC to respond directly to Water supply issue in Brack Ashati in a targeted manner which reaches out to local citizens affected by these issues.

The aim of this activity is to increase Ubari residents' awareness of the Municipal Council’s effort to address critical recovery needs in cooperation with relevant national ministries. In 2016, LTI 2 supported the Ubari Municipal Council and other local governance stakeholders to lead public listening sessions in Ubari to understand residents' priorities for recovery after the 2 year conflict between the Tabu and Tawarge tribes that came to an end in 2016. Listening sessions with the community were followed by a planning session among the Municipal Council, key ministry representatives, elders council members, a local crisis committee, and civil society leaders to prioritize projects (including education, water, and public sanitation efforts) to help the city recover and provide services to returning residents. Based on the outcome of this participatory process, LTI 2 will support the Ubari Municipal Council and Ministry of Education to make critical repairs at 3 public schools in central Ubari and conduct a public awareness campaign about the effort. The 3 schools include Aljeel Alsaad, Alkordaia School, and Nuqba ben Nafee School, which serve a total of 2,280 male and female students. The repairs will include installing new windows, doors, and water and sanitation fixtures. In addition, LTI 2 will work with the Ubari municipal council to conduct a media and public awareness campaign under the broader ""Our Shared Responsibility"" theme to highlight the Municipal Council and ministry roles. This activity will contribute to short-term stability and recovery in Ubari following the peace agreement between Tebu and Tawarge tribes and strengthen confidence in the participatory basic service delivery process led by the municipal council and national ministries.

If the Ubari Municipal Council and the Ministry of Education make critical repairs at 3 public schools in central Ubari and conduct an awareness campaign about the effort, then residents will have increased awareness of the Municipal Council’s effort to address critical needs identified in public consultations in cooperation with relevant national authorities, because:

- With outreach surrounding the project, the intervention will be a highly visible activity that has a positive benefit for a broad segment of the population.

- Schools are one of the most important service delivery issues to address based on feedback from the listening sessions held in Ubari in 2016 (SAB016) to get input from residents and prioritize needs of the community.

- The demands raised by attendees of the public listening in the 3 largest neighborhoods of Shareb, Farming, and Baladeyah are representative of all residents' priorities in Ubari.

- The awareness and information campaign will give the public information about both the municipal council and the Ministry of Education (MOE) roles in implementing the activity.



- Ubari municipal council will have strong coordination with the Ministry of Education throughout the process.

Ubari in Southern Libya is recovering from nearly 2 years of tribal conflict and displacement of its residents. In late 2015 Tabu and Tawarge tribes signed a peace deal, paving the way for thousands of displaced Ubari residents to return to their homes. The return of IDPs and rehabilitation of infrastructure damaged by the fighting present a significant window of opportunity for the Ubari municipal council, which was elected shortly before the conflict began. Due to the fighting and displacement, the municipal council is just beginning to establish a relationship with residents and launch service delivery efforts. However, with the stabilization of Ubari, the municipal council and Mayor Taher Milad are interested in playing a key role in recovery efforts to support the return to normal life. Municipal council members have traveled to Tunis and Tripoli multiple times seeking support from Presidency Council to rehabilitate basic services in Ubari which will help IDPs to return home. In July 2016, LTI 2 supported the Ubari municipal council to lead listening sessions in the 3 largest neighborhoods in central Ubari, followed by a planning session with key ministry representatives, elders council, crisis committee, and civil society leaders. Based on public feedback, Ubari citizens’ top service delivery priorities for their communities were: (1) cleanup of central Ubari and resuming public sanitation services; (2) rehabilitating water supply infrastructure, and (3) rehabilitation of public schools. Based on findings from the listening sessions, LTI 2 agreed with Ubari municipal council and the Ministry of Education to provide support for rehabilitating some of the schools. Additionally, a UNDP stabilization facility assessment of Ubari in August 2016 highlighted school repairs as an urgent recovery priority. 

In this activity, LTI 2 will help the Ubari municipal council respond to the citizen demands raised in public consultations by supporting the Ubari municipal council and Ministry of Education to to make critical repairs at 3 public schools in Ubari, including repairing restrooms and replacing windows and doors. The schools, which include male and female students, are Aljeel Alsaad School (640 students), Alkordaia School (1280 students), and Nuqba ben Nafee School (360 students). There are 12 schools in Ubari that require rehabilitation support. LTI 2 has agreed with the MC to start with the 3 most critical schools in terms of unmet needs at this time. The 3 sites have been identified by the Ubari MC, and supporting the 3 sites will greatly improve the educational environment for students. LTI 2 is coordinating closely with the UNDP Stabilization Facility, which is also conducting work in Ubari, and met with UNDP to de-conflict efforts to support school repairs and other efforts in Ubari. In addition, LTI 2 will work with Ubari municipal council to conduct a media and public awareness campaign to highlight the municipal council and Ministry of Education’s efforts to address the city’s service delivery priorities. Outreach efforts will help demonstrate to citizens that the Ubari municipal council heard citizen priorities in the listening sessions and has quickly responded with efforts to rehabilitate schools harmed by the conflict.

This activity will provide the Ubari Municipal Council with increased management capacity to effectively implement and report on LTI 2-funded service delivery activities in Ubari. To achieve this objective, LTI 2 will help the Ubari MC fund a Field Program Assistant (FPA) to support the Municipal Council and LTI 2 in implementing, monitoring, and reporting on service delivery projects in Ubari. The MC and Mayor Taher Milad is trying to lead recovery efforts to support the return to normal life following 2 years of conflict in Ubari. LTI 2 is supporting these efforts in the education, water, and other sectors, and helping the MC strengthen linkages to national institutions, residents, civil society, and tribal leaders. Still, the MC has just recently begun operations in Ubari and has limited institutional capacity. The part-time FPA will strengthen regular communication and coordination between the Ubari MC and LTI 2 Sabha team to increase the speed and effectiveness of projects in the Ubari cluster. The FPA will help the MC with implementation, monitoring/evaluation, documentation, and reporting for LTI 2 supported activities. The FPA is a teacher and has been very involved in Ubari civil society since the 2011 revolution. He played a lead role in the development of the Ubari Information Center in 2013 and was active in 2012-2014 in efforts to strengthen public awareness of the constitutional process and electoral processes. He has  strong relationship with the MC, the community, tribal leaders, and CSOs.

If Ubari Field Program Assistant supports the Municipal Council and LTI 2 in implementing, monitoring, and reporting on service delivery projects in Ubari,THEN Ubari MC has increased capacity to effectively implement and report on LTI 2-funded activities BECAUSE: 

- We assume the Ubari MC has limited institutional capacity and additional management support will strengthen project implementation

- We assume the FPA will strengthen regular communication and coordination between Ubari MC and LTI 2 Sabha team

- We assume the FPA is a trusted, credible individual with a good relationship with both the MC and the community

Ubari in Southern Libya is recovering from nearly 2 years of tribal conflict and displacement of its residents. In late 2015 rival tribes signed a peace deal, paving the way for thousands of displaced Ubari residents to return to their homes this year. The return and recovery is a significant window of opportunity for the Ubari municipal council, which was elected in 2014 shortly before the conflict began. Due to the fighting and displacement, the MC is just beginning to develop a relationship with residents, establish operations, and stand up service delivery efforts. The MC headquarters was damaged during the fighting, and the MC as an institution has very limited internal capacity. However, with the stabilization of Ubari, the MC and Mayor Taher Milad is interested to play a key role in recovery efforts to support the return to normal life. In July, LTI 2 supported the Ubari MC to lead listening sessions in the 3 largest neighborhoods in central Ubari, followed by a planning session with key ministry representatives, elders council, crisis committee, and civil society leaders. Based on public feedback, LTI 2 has been working the MC and national government authorities present in the south to respond to recover needs in water, education, and other areas. However, these efforts have moved slowly due to the limited capacity of the municipal council itself, the poor infrastructure in Ubari, and the distance between Ubari and LTI's office in Sabha.
Thus, in this activity, LTI 2 will fund a field program assistant (FPA) to support the Ubari municipal council in implementing, monitoring, and reporting on projects in Ubari. The FPA will bolster the MC's capacity to implement LTI 2-funded service delivery and rehabilitation projects and strengthen public outreach and communication efforts. The FPA will also regularly monitor and report on Ubari MC activities to LTI2 team in Sabha, and he will be critical to LTI 2 efforts to strengthen M&E for the Ubari cluster of activities. The FPA is a teacher and has been very involved in Ubari civil society since the 2011 revolution. He played a lead role in the development of the Ubari Information Center in 2013 and was active in 2012-2014 in efforts to strengthen public awareness of the constitutional process and electoral processes.He will travel once a week to Sabha and spend a day in the office each week with the South program staff.

This activity aims to support the need for increased support for civil society organizations (CSOs) in southwest Libya, and would develop their capacity to engage with the local population and national political groups. The activity will support Tajuma Fezzan to run monthly networking and roundtable events by providing rental of office and workshop space for one year. The activity will seek to improve the operating environment for CSOs in the south by improving networking, coordination and advocacy on issues particularly relevant to the transition in southwest Libya. In addition to Tajuma Fezzan, the activity will involve a wide variety of local organizations, and also include political actors, tribal elders, and other relevant groups.

",Network South: Roundtable discussions with key figures in Sabha,"
Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in southern Libya have been the focus of significantly less attention than their compatriots in the North. The influence of state institutions in the south is also extremely limited, meaning that organizations have had to play an active role to develop their own space and areas of focus. While this means that their capacity in terms of administrative structures is often limited, the role of these groups has been pivotal in terms of engaging the local population, and laying the foundations for further engagement to promote stability during the transitional period.

Sabha is the main hub of Libya’s south west, and is the focus area for many CSOs, which have often formed alliances and coalitions across the region from Sabha into towns further afield such as Ubari, Murzuq and Ghat. However, these coalitions require support to ensure that they are maintained as the transition process continues, and to promote a diverse range of activities which continues to involve the local communities in these areas. This is especially important in the south due to the lack of state influence, and the difficulty in communicating across remote and inaccessible areas.

Tajuma Fezzan is a collaborative organization that has developed a reach across the south and established itself as an organization capable of bringing together a large number of people from different geographic areas. This activity would seek to capitalize on their success so far by establishing an ongoing series of events which would take place over one year and bring together organizations and key actors from across the south to discuss key issues they face, and work together to develop solutions which engage local people and state institutions.

The activity would provide Tajuma Fezzan with an office space for one year, in which they would run regular roundtable discussions (a minimum of one per month, but expected to be every two weeks) which focus on key aspects of the transition in the south, and directly link into national processes of dialogue, transitional justice, and political reform. Tajuma Fezzan expect to receive funding for conducting activities from the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) and other potential donors, and have highlighted that the key requirement at this time is an office space which provides a focal point for organizations wishing to work on transitional issues. 

In addition to the benefits for the participants, these events would provide the Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) with a regular opportunity to meet with CSOs and other local groups, to engage and discuss activity development in the neutral setting of Tajuma Fezzan’s office.

This activity assumes that the CSO environment in the south would be boosted through improved discussion and collaboration as a result of the ‘space’ provided by the office and events which are organized by Tajuma Fezzan.

",Supporting Women’s Dialogue and Access to Information in Sabha,"
Since the liberation of the country in August 2011, severe tensions have occurred during the transition process. While the revolution opened Libya’s political space, after 42 years of repression, Libyans have little experience with political engagement and there is a lingering legacy of alienation. Many Libyans do not understand the basic vocabulary on the fundamentals of democracy, constitution making and elections. This lack of understanding inhibits effective and productive dialogue on transitional issues that are currently ongoing in the country. Also by not understanding these issues, the population, especially in areas outside of the major cities, and civil society, are constrained in their contributions and their ability to effectively participate in the process is weakened.

While the Internet is very popular in Libya as a means for obtaining information, not all families have Internet access in their homes and women in Sabha are restricted by societal norms from accessing public Internet cafes.  This center will allow women to connect with others locally and nationally to learn more about the activities and developments taking place in the political and cultural spheres.  

Basmat Shebab is an active organization with good links in the community; therefore it is well placed to manage the center. In addition to the computers and IT training, Basmat Shebab plan to use the center as a location for Women’s dialogue sessions which focus on important aspects of Libya’s transition. The children’s play equipment which will be provided to the center will encourage participation in these sessions by creating an atmosphere which reduced any stigma attached to women’s participation in dialogue or political events.

This activity is aimed at the implementation of a information center of seventeen computers, with VSAT broadband. It aims to create a suitable space where women and CSOs will be able to access and share information about the issues related to the political transition and general news about Libya and the world. The IT trainings to be conducted at the center will also enable women to become more proficient in the utilization of technology and learn more about how to participate in political processes such as the upcoming elections of the constitutional drafting committee.

The center run by Basmat Shebab will create a space that will assist women and civil society organizations to develop skills, networks, and tools necessary to mobilize advocacy networks, meaningfully engage in political processes, and monitor the transition’s progress. The center will be based in the building of the Local Council of Mahdiye in the neighborhood of Mahdiey, for which the grantee has secured permission to use for a minimum of one year. This location provides a neutral space for women and CSO members to engage in dialogue, and to access information and IT resources in an informal location which is considered culturally appropriate. 

LTI plans to promote sustainability of the center by hiring an STTA (TRIP066) who will work with the grantee to develop a business model to maintain Internet connection costs. Since LTI has implemented this type of civil society-internet center arrangement in multiple areas, this technical expertise is planned to be hired through a separate STTA rather than as a budget line for this individual grant. 

The assumption behind this activity is that increased access to information and skills will contribute to Libyans playing a more active role in the transitional processes. By empowering the public to learn about the constitution, human rights, reconciliation, transitional justice and other related transition issues through IT and the center, this will facilitate discussions and dialogue around key political processes such as the constitutional drafting process and elections. The center will function as a medium for people, particularly women, to gather and learn about political topics and it will be accessible to the general population of Sabah.

",Amplifying the Voice of the South: Transition Radio Programming,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust towards government.  

Sabha is the central city in the southwest region, which is critical to the stability of Libya’s post-revolution transition. State presence is weak, political progress has faltered, and the area’s diverse communities remain divided and disconnected. Although the revolution shifted the balance of local power dynamics, the transition has not altered the deeply rooted legacy of patronage politics, tribal manipulations, and underdevelopment that characterized four decades of Qadhafi’s rule. As a result, old issues and new dynamics are fueling a pervasive sense of marginalization, funneling conflict along communal fault lines, and fanning fears that opportunistic extremists will fill the space in search of a safe haven and smuggling routes.

The Voice of Free Sabha (VFS) started in 1995 as a part of the state-run Aljamahiryia Broadcasting Agency. It was taken off the air during the revolution and taken over by revolutionaries around September 2011. In August 2011, authorities in Tripoli ordered the previous radio station leadership to sabotage and steal equipment so that it did not fall into the hands of thuwar. The station began rebroadcasting in September 2011. VFS is managed by Abubakr Abushrei’aa, and he has worked in media for 17 years, and is one of the few employees from the previous management who continued to work for the new station. Most of VFS’s staff are young volunteers from the area.

LTI is working with a radio station in Sabha in the south of Libya to support free media and programming on key issues related to the transition. So far this support has been limited to the provision of equipment intended to expand the reach of radio transmission beyond Sabha to include a number of surrounding towns. Once the equipment has been installed, basic signal testing will be conducted to estimate the reach of radio broadcasting. 

Through the provision of an STTA to the Voice of Free Sabha for a period of at least three months, this activity will support the continued development of the radio station as a positive media influence in the South. Specifically, this grant will provide practical training and mentoring on both technical use of equipment, and responsible programming on key transitional issues. The STTA will also explore ways to better connect the Voice of Free Sabha’s programming with listeners both across the south and nationwide. Finally, this STTA will also feed into conversations on possible cross-border radio initiatives, and potentially play a role in developing these depending on the outcome of initial assessments.

This activity assumes that by providing training and mentoring to the Voice of Free Sabah team, and by engaging the public in discussion on transition related issues; that positive engagement in key political and transitional processes will be increased, as will the influence of moderate voices in the south of Libya.

",Voice from the South: Navigating Women Rights in Constitution & Legislation,"
Since the liberation of the country in August 2011, severe tensions have occurred during the transition process. While the revolution opened Libya’s political space, after 42 years of repression, Libyans have little experience with political engagement and there is a lingering legacy of alienation. Many Libyans do not understand the basic vocabulary on the fundamentals of democracy, constitution making and elections. The underdevelopment of institutions that governs these principles further exacerbates the lack of understanding and inhibits effective and productive dialogue on transitional issues that are currently ongoing in the country. Also by not understanding these issues, the population, especially in areas outside the major cities, and civil society, are constrained in their contributions and their ability to effectively participate in the process is weakened. 

Sabha is located in the southwestern region of Libya and is by many considered the “capital of the south.” With over 150,000 inhabitants it is a hub for most activities taking place in southern Libya and connects the surrounding cities such as Ubari, Murzuq and Brak as a vital focal point, politically and economically. South Libya is diverse region with several ethnic and social groups: Arabs, Tuaregs and Tebu which introduces challenges, but also opportunities. The region exercising unrest and instability. Yet, many of the obstacles are the result of underdevelopment and a lack of focus on the south from the central government. OTI’s presence in Sabha seeks to develop activities and programs that are tailored for Sabha and its unique challenges while playing into a larger regional activity pool, hence thinking and acting locally, yet being part of a national movement. 

Women’s participation in civil society and politics is important in securing an inclusive and democratic path for Libya as the country now seeks to codify national legislation, human rights and strengthen governmental institutions. However, the participation of Libyan women in the public sphere remains limited after the country’s revolution, especially for women outside the urban centers and more conservative and traditional suburbs. It is vital that Libyan women’s rights are fully included in future legislation and that they have the advocacy tools to guarantee that their voice reaches policy-makers, and that their needs are reflected in future laws and the upcoming constitution-writing process.

Libyan Women Union in the South (LWUS) has since 2011 fought to promote women and human rights through social work, engaging politicians through advocacy and engaging women through workshops. Sabha Women’s Union has participated in creating a participatory space for women, the organization builds on one of the tenants of democracy namely the inclusion of women as a vital and important part of stabilizing the political process Libya now goes through. LWUS is one of the biggest organizations in Sabha and has an educated and capable staff. 

This grant seeks to facilitate a two day conference in Sabha for NGOs working on women’s issues from all parts of southwest Libya (78 participants from Sabha, 25 from different southwest towns, (2 Murzuq, 5 Alshati, 5 Ubari, 3 form Ghat, 6 from Qatroon, 2 from Zeegin, one from Ghadwa, one from Tamanhent). In addition, the conference will be attended by 13 men and women representing the national  leadership and known as women rights defenders, They are from towns in the coast; Tripoli, Benghazi,  Misrata Khumos and Tubroq. The conference theme will be presented by six presenters. All the papers will be reviewed and edited by 3 senior advisors from University of Sabha.  The conference will be covered by 26 media experts representing 13 national and regional media outlets. LWUS consolidate a committee of 9 active members as the conference Secretary committee.  

The aims of the conference are:   

1) 	Women in the south will together and discuss ways to ensure full respect and consideration for Libyan women’s rights in the upcoming constitution. This discussion will be led by three experts who will present three papers. Following by a focus group that will discuss the paper's topic and come up with recommendations. 

2)	 Women will discuss the Libyan legislations affecting women's rights as equal citizens with focus on what women would like to see in the Libyan legislation?  Discussion will cover main topics such as the rights of woman to pass her citizenship to her children, the social security support for the children of non-Libya husbands. And all related rights that will satisfy equal citizenship for Libyan women in the legislation. This topic will be covered by two papers presented by a legal experts. Participates will then form small focus group to discuss and define messages and demands to insure women rights in Libyan legislation. 

3)	 A presentation will be presented and focused on Libyan women pioneers’ leadership and light the shadow on achievements inspired and thriven by Libyan women. 

4)	 The conference will lay out the foundation for NGOs cooperation among women in southern Libya. This is a novel and experimental undertaking but will secure a foundation for future work and cooperation. During the workshop, LWUS will distribute a questionnaire to the participants to gather information on local NGOs participated in the conference, women’s views on political transition and democratic process in their country. 

5) Gathered data from the questionnaire will be used to build a foundation for database that includes organizations, individuals who are active in women rights related issues, the second part of the information will be analyzed and published in into a newsletter that will be sent to the participants, political institutions in Sabha, the local council, national government and GNC. Providing  informative outreach tools to guarantee, LTI will support inclusion of women and that women’s voices are reaching policy-makers, and their needs are reflected in the upcoming constitution-building process and in future laws

6)	 The conference will be attended by 26 media experts from 13 media outlet: TV, local radio local newspapers and journalists to insure enough publicity for southern women voices. 

The outcome of this grant is to build a stronger network among NGOs dealing with women issues and create a foundation for future work and cooperation for LWUS. Paired with the local knowledge and resources each organization has, this could be a good source for strong unified action for women in the south to advocate for their rights. The conference will also strengthen women’s understanding of the political processes and secure active engagement for the future.

",Prioritizing Community Improvements and Community Security in South West Libya,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust towards government.  

Recent events in southern Libya have highlighted the volatility of the region, as well as the need for sustained engagement by international partners. Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in southern Libya have been the focus of significantly less attention than their compatriots in the North. The influence of state institutions in the south is also extremely limited, meaning that organizations have had to play an active role to develop their own space and areas of focus. While this means that their capacity in terms of administrative structures is often limited, the role of these groups has been pivotal in terms of engaging the local population, and laying the foundations for further engagement to promote stability during the transitional period. 

LTI is currently in the process of ramping up and looking for programmatic opportunities in the South and LTI looks to support catalytic community improvement that builds government legitimacy and boosts community security.

o	  Boosting government legitimacy and community activism through high visibility community improvement projects. These efforts would particularly target either high profile locations or targeted communities.
o	  Engaging with moderate voices (including media, CSO leaders, and dialogue initiatives that seek to build constructive links across a broad range of groups).
o	  Targeting youth – identifying and prioritizing activities to engage youth in the transition through activities both targeting and lead by youth in Tripoli.
o	  Development of civil society advocacy and conflict mitigation networks (community watch groups, security liaison forums, anti-weapons advocacy, etc.)
o	  Support creative initiatives that capture attention, generate buzz, and spark engagement in transition processes.

In spite of the work by CSOs and other groups, there remains significant need in terms of community development in the south, and as a result, LTI is seeking to work with CSOs, local authorities, community leaders, local businesses and other groups to develop community improvement activities in Sabha and the surrounding towns. These activities will build upon the priorities of local communities and engage them to shape the development of the region.  

This position would work with local communities in Sabha and the surrounding towns to 1) engage the population in community improvement programming, 2) facilitate meetings and workshops to identify and prioritize needs, and 3) develop recommendations and activities to respond to community requirements within the objectives of the LTI program.

",On Alert! Crisis Response Fund in Southwestern Libya,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust towards government.  

Sabha is located in the southwestern region of Libya and is by many considered the “capital of the south.” With over 150,000 inhabitants, Sabha is a hub for most activities taking place in southwestern Libya and connects surrounding cities such as Ubari, Murzuq and Brak as a vital political and economic focal point.  Most of the trade coming from Niger, Chad and Sub-Saharan country also travels through Sabha and several industries cater to these trade routes. The make up of the city is mixed between Arabs, Tuaregs and Tebu, which introduces challenges and opportunities. Sabha and surrounding towns such as Ubari and Murzuq have unfortunately seen several deadly clashes the last months. 

The beginning of 2014 was not a good start of the new year in Sabha and the southwest as tribal and political fighting has left over 110 people dead and over 250 wounded. The rise of former pro-Qadhafi loyalist has also scared many in the south, as they have had to defend themselves against militias seeking to overturn the revolution and bring back the Qadhafi family and the parts of the former regime. The grief is further exacerbated as many feel that the central government in Tripoli did little to nothing to stop the violence and help the citizens of Sabha, a city that in the last days of January ran out of most vital items such as food, petrol and medicine. The sense of marginalization is dangerous in a state that struggles to keep its citizens united. Many of the obstacles are the result of systemic underdevelopment and a lack of focus on the south from the central government.

This DDGS will create a flexible fund to rapidly respond to urgent requests for support from civil society organization that are trying to do positive, practical things to push back against the declining security trends. LTI has received requests from organizations such as Toumast in Ubari for quick interventions like holding dialogues to promote reconciliation. The crisis fund may also support light rehabilitation and conducting peace messaging and outreach campaigns. This DDGS will create a responsive mechanism and clear process so that OTI can swiftly approve an array of anticipated civil society-led activities to bolster stability in the southwest during a critical period in the Libya’s transition.

This activity assumes that there will be sufficient security in the south over the next four months to provide stable space for civil society to conduct activities on the ground.

Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhaffi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.

OTI’s presence in Sabha seeks to develop activities and programs that are tailored for Sabha and its unique challenges while playing into a larger regional activity pool, hence thinking and acting locally, yet being part of a national movement.  

With the fall of the Qadhafi regime and the unrest which followed, a large amount of weapons have been stockpiled by militias, tribes and families. The easy access to weapons continues to fuel the unrest in Libya. Tribes, militias and others sooner turn to their arsenals than engage in conciliation. In the south inter-tribal fighting permeates the landscape. Weapons are commonplace and they are frequently used to settle conflict. As the state does not manage to respond to tension the culture of violence triumphs time tested and traditional conciliation. One of the most volatile groups are young people who are often dragged into these conflicts by tribal affiliation, honor, but also for thrill seeking. Engaging high school students and giving them a foundation of the dangerous implications of weapons through engaging campaigns is an important step towards preventing violence and use of weapons as a means of conflict solution. The message will also reach their friends and families spreading the knowledge about the risk of weapons. 

La Tahzan is a Sabha based organization whose charitable work is well received in the city. It is a largely female based organization with a few male members. Most of the members work as teachers in various schools in the city and see the importance of weapons awareness in their daily work. 

This activity will develop a two day workshop on weapons awareness, training selected individuals and enable them to convey the message to vulnerable groups and how to plan for effective campaigning. The workshop will educate and train 30 teachers and five members of five NGOs in Sabha. The focus will be engaging youth in Sabha. This workshop will be developed by an anti-weapons advisor in coordination with La Tahzan. The advisor will also be responsible for co-hosting the workshop together with La Tahzan. The advisor will be responsible for developing a program that teachers can use in a classroom setting, and civil society groups when engaging youth through campaigns. This tool kit will be developed by the advisor before he travels to Sabha. 

After the workshop the teachers will return to their schools and organize school campaigns fitting the local needs and using the kits developed by the anti-weapons advisor. The teachers will select up to 30 students each from six school totaling 180 students. The teachers will hold a session with their respective groups and conduct a brief training session for their students. The six schools are in the following neighborhoods: Al-Mahdiyye, Al-Manshiyye, Al-Qurda, Al-Naseriyye, Al-Tayouri and Al, Jadid. The 180 students together with their teachers and the five NGOs members, will go to the five busiest streets and roundabouts in Sabha to spread awareness and distribute flyers, posting sticky posters and wearing their t-shirts and hats with the anti-weapons message. The targets areas are: the University Roundabout, Al-Seif street, The Fezzan Hotel roundabout, Qala hotel street, and the hospital roundabout street. This will be coordinated with La Tahzan. 

La Tahzan will invite local media to cover the workshop. They will also announce the activity on social media outlets such as Facebook and twitter. 

This activity assumes that engaging with youth in high schools and through public campaigns in the streets is the good way of securing more awareness about the dangers of weapons and promote stability in more visible way to citizens. This generation has had little time to reflect on the changes they have seen around them and this activity can be an important step for many young individuals to start put into perspective the down-sides to weapons.

",Understanding Media Messaging in Southwestern Libya,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

Sabah is the central city in the southwest region, which is critical to the stability of Libya’s post-revolution transition. State presence is weak, political progress has faltered, and the area’s diverse communities remain divided and disconnected. Although the revolution shifted the balance of local power dynamics, the transition has not altered the deeply rooted legacy of patronage politics, tribal manipulations, and underdevelopment that characterized four decades of Qadhafi’s rule. As a result, old issues and new dynamics are fueling a pervasive sense of marginalization, funneling conflict along communal fault lines, and fanning fears that opportunistic extremists will fill the space in search of a safe haven and smuggling routes.

As part of the ongoing ramp up, LTI is expanding and deepening its engagement in southwestern Libya. In December, LTI began exploring the idea of using local media monitoring as a tool to shape strategy, design programming, and gauge impact. There were five specific objectives for supporting this type of activity in the southwest:

•  	Monitor the content of the Voice of Free Sabah to ensure that LTI’s hardware support (TRIP069) is being used responsibility;
•	  Provide content and sentiment analysis that can help LTI’s radio STTA (SABH003) work with the Voice of Free Sabah to develop more tailored and targeted radio content; 
•	  Provide additional atmospherics and analysis. Vast, sparsely population, and isolated, the southwest is a key geographic focus for the ramp up. Improved situational awareness and contextual analysis will be critical to ensure that LTI’s expansion in this area is closely calibrated to local dynamics;
•	  Gather data that can be fed back to key stakeholders to help inform policy, shape strategic communications, and provide input to transition processes (e.g. National Dialogue, constitution drafting, etc.);
•	  Help identify opportunities for cross-border media initiatives. GNI has several media monitoring programs across the Sahel, including in Niger and with OTI in Mali.

GNI is a data and communications company that with a unique ability to monitor a wide range of local media sources, mine this data to identify trends and patterns, and produce customizable analysis of local content, sentiment, and influence. In Syria, the State Department contracts GNI to monitor USG-supported local radio stations in order to confirm that these outlets are not broadcasting inflammatory, extremist, or destabilizing rhetoric that is inconsistent with the objectives of USG support. In Mali, OTI’s Mali Transition Initiative (MTI) is working on local media monitoring with GNI in order to support more informed and responsive program decision making.

This activity assumes that monitoring local media in the southwest will provide actionable analysis that will help LTI more effectively target, tailor, and monitor programming.

","Boosting Positive Space and Youth in Al-Mahdiyye, Sabha","
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with the Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

Sabha is located in the southwestern region of Libya and is by many considered the “capital of the South.” With over 150,000 inhabitants, it is a hub for most activities taking place in southern Libya and connects surrounding cities such as Ubari, Murzuq, and Barak both politically and economically. Most of the trade coming from Niger, Chad and sub-Saharan countries also travels through Sabha and several industries cater to this trade route. Sabha is home to Arab, Tuareg and Tebu tribes and early 2014 saw several deadly clashes between the different groups. In addition to inter-ethnic tensions, Sabha faces a host of security and governance obstacles as a result of underdevelopment.  The Qadhafi regime did not prioritize the South and residents perceive this practice as continuing today. LTI’s presence in Sabha seeks to develop activities and programs that are tailored for Sabha and its unique challenges while also contributing to a larger regional activity pool.  

In response to these trends, LTI is implementing clusters of visible, tangible community engagement projects that help foster interaction between communities and their government, bolster community activism, and spark local-level change. By bringing together local authorities, civil society, and community members to deliver practical projects like rehabilitating community parks or other public spaces, these activities aim to build relationships among key stakeholders and improve confidence in the transition and in local stakeholders. The projects also seek to empower moderate voices to ‘Think Nationally, Act Locally,” strengthen local resiliencies that reject extremism, and promote conflict-sensitive local development. To maximize impact, LTI will work with local partners to ensure that there is a media plan in place to publicize and promote the projects. 

Al-Mahdiyye Sports Club is located in Al-Mahdiyye neighborhood of Sabha. The club has a volleyball court and a newly constructed football field that gathers the youth around sports activities. The club has as estimated 900 members, including approximately 500 youth. It is unclear how many members are women.  The club’s membership draws on all surrounding tribal communities, making it an important space for intertribal interaction through positive activities. During times of tribal conflict, this club serves as a critical space for sustained community cohesion. In coordination with local government authorities and the club’s administration, LTI will support the club to grow its sports programs and expand its work with the youth who are vital to promoting peaceful intertribal interactions in Sabha. 

In addition to providing the club with sports and recreational equipment, this activity will also support two community events during the month of Ramadan in order to proactively engage youth in target areas.  It is expected that these activities will be a large opening ceremony and at least one sports competition.  These activities will highlight the new equipment and changes to the Club, which in turn will help encourage more youth to go regularly to the space.  LTI will also encourage the Club to more actively recruit women, and provide opportunities and space for them.

","Boosting Positive Space and Youth in Al-Sharara, Sabha","
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya's transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with the Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

Sabha is located in the southwestern region of Libya and is by many considered the capital of the South. With over 150,000 inhabitants, it is a hub for most activities taking place in southern Libya and connects surrounding cities such as Ubari, Murzuq, and Barak both politically and economically. Most of the trade coming from Niger, Chad and sub-Saharan countries also travels through Sabha and several industries cater to this trade route. Sabha is home to Arab, Tuareg and Tebu tribes and early 2014 saw several deadly clashes between the different groups. In addition to inter-ethnic tensions, Sabha faces a host of security and governance obstacles as a result of underdevelopment.  The Qadhafi regime did not prioritize the South and residents perceive this practice as continuing today. LTI's presence in Sabha seeks to develop activities and programs that are tailored for Sabha and its unique challenges while also contributing to a larger regional activity pool.  

In response to these trends, LTI is implementing clusters of visible, tangible community engagement projects that help foster interaction between communities and their government, bolster community activism, and spark local-level change. By bringing together local authorities, civil society, and community members to deliver practical projects like rehabilitating community parks or other public spaces, these activities aim to build relationships among key stakeholders and improve confidence in the transition and in local stakeholders. The projects also seek to empower moderate voices to Think Nationally, Act Locally, strengthen local resiliencies that reject extremism, and promote conflict-sensitive local development. To maximize impact, LTI will work with local partners to ensure that there is a media plan in place to publicize and promote the projects. 

Al-Sharara Sports Club is located between the Al-Manshiyye and the Al-Qurda neighborhood Sabha, both of which are known as being tribally integrated areas. The club has 2,000 registered members, including approximately 500 youth and 200 women.  The club's membership draws on all surrounding tribal communities, making it an important space for intertribal interaction through positive activities. During times of tribal conflict, this club serves as a critical space for sustained community cohesion. In coordination with local government authorities and the club's administration, LTI will support the club to grow its sports programs and expand its work with youth which are vital to promoting peaceful intertribal interactions in Sabha. The club is especially keen to attract more women and will organize women's days twice a week. 

In addition to providing the club with sports and recreational equipment, this activity will also support two community events during the month of Ramadan in order to proactively engage youth in target areas, giving them space to grow and contribute to the Libyan transition in a positive manner. It is expected that these activities will be a large opening ceremony and at least one sports competition.  These activities will highlight the new equipment and changes to the Club, which in turn will help encourage more youth to go regularly to the space.  

This activity will coordinate closely with local government officials.  As a symbol of government support and participation in this activity, the Sabha Director of the Office of the Ministry of Youth and Sport who has agreed to co-brand with USAID.

This activity will inform OTI programming in southwest Libya and the Libya-Niger border region (in cooperation with OTI Niger) by providing current analysis of cross border dynamics and personalities that impact stability, primarily in southwest Libya and also in Niger. The activity will comprise four field research reports that will result in analytical studies of: illicit gold mining; key personalities; cross-border movements in the Libya-Niger border region; and grievance narratives around Arlit (Uranium Mining Region) which could affect stability in Northern Niger and Southern Libya. The stability of southwest Libya is to a great degree determined by cross-border movement and influence yet their dynamics remain under researched and poorly understood. Navanti is an innovative research and analysis organization with a demonstrated track record of producing high quality products in Libya and the region.

",Understanding Cross Border Dynamics & Personalities in the Sahel Maghreb,"
Libya’s post-revolution political transition has become derailed. Voter registration for legislative elections to the House of Representatives (HOR) in June 2014 dropped to 42 per cent of eligible voters, compared to 62 per cent in 2012 elections for the General National Council (GNC), reflecting growing disaffection at the political process. Subsequently, in July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli and its airport, with Islamist-aligned forces under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Libya Dawn associates in the HOR boycotted the new legislature and challenged its legality in the Supreme Court. Despite international recognition of the HOR, a rump GNC was resurrected and a parallel government formed. Each alliance has sought to recruit proxy militias, inflaming local conflicts and fuelling instability across Libya. Citizens have become the victims of this political-military competition and have diminishing faith in democratic institutions to resolve it. The country faces unprecedented polarization, with fears that it will split violently along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict. This resolution would provide the foundation on which to resurrect the political transition, the basis for sustainable peace in Libya.

Complicating internal drivers of instability, regional dynamics play a significant part in determining stability in Libya’s southwest corridor. The Tuareg and Tebu tribes straddle international borders with Mali and Niger, where boundaries are poorly demarcated and enforced. These tribes have been marginalized by their respective governments, causing them to resist central authority. They are currently engaged in significant conflict in southern Libya, particularly in Ubari. This Toubou-Tuareg conflict threatens to become a proxy of the larger conflict between Libya Dawn and Operation Dignity which is unfolding across Libya. Both alliances want to secure control of the southern oil fields and military support from the southerners.

Little is understood about the role of non-Libyan Tebu and Tuareg in the southern conflicts. Economic interests evidently drive much of the cross-border interaction, based on illicit trade and smuggling – gold mines are a key focus of economic competition. Drugs, weapons and people flow across the borders unrestricted, importing and exporting instability. Extremist groups have also taken advantage of the lawlessness and marginalization in the region to establish military operations with impunity. The international community is increasing its own military presence to disrupt Islamic extremist operations, but little is understood about how these operations interact with the wider drivers of trade and conflict, as well as the local actors who most influence it.

LTI 2 intends to expand programming in southern Libya to include cross-border interventions, possibly in coordination with OTI’s newly-established programme in Niger. Better contextual understanding of cross-border dynamics will ensure that these interventions are suitably calibrated. To that end, this activity will use Field Research Reports to commission research into cross-border interactions between Libya and Niger, in order to inform OTI programming in Libya and Niger. The research will document influential actors in the communities on both sides of the border, with a view to identifying potential voices for non-violence and dialogue. The specifics of the products below are found the Awardee Reporting and Deliverables section.

This activity aims to increase cooperation among GNA ministries, community leaders, Misrata MC, and the Sirte Crisis Committee in addressing critical recovery needs in the Abu Grain area. To achieve this goal, LTI will facilitate a cooperative process among these actors and provide in-kind support s to refurbish 9 schools and 2 medical centers in Abu Grain and Wishka area and holds public outreach meetings. Furthermore, LTI will support a number of public outreach meetings and strong public information campaign between local authorities (sub-local councils in Abu Grain and Wishka), representatives of IDP communities in these towns, National ministries (education and health), Misrata MC, and Sirte Crisis Committee. Rapid improvements in basic service delivery and public outreach and communications will be particularly critical for medium-term stability.Abu Grain/Wishka area is located in between Misrata and Sirte along the coast about 150 kilometers from each city. There area was occupied by IS for over two weeks during the fighting. This badly impacted its public facilities and left the local authorities paralyzed in delivering vital health and education services to the returning residents and IDPs still in the area, around 10-12,000 individuals total.

If LTI supports ministry officials, community leaders, the Sirte Crisis Committee, and Misrata MC, to refurbish schools and medical centers in Abu Grain and Wishka and conduct public outreach efforts, then there will be increased cooperation among all of these actors in addressing critical recovery needs in the Abu Grain area. - The governance situation in and around Sirte is very unclear – roles and responsibilities, legitimacy of various institutions and individuals. This includes both public perceptions and legal standing.- Given the uncertainty of the local governance situation, our preliminary strategy is to promote cooperation among all relevant stakeholders – with GNA ministries and community officials in the lead.- GNA ministries of health and education have a clear mandate for technical oversight of health and education services. Their involvement and leadership makes sense.- Community-level leaders (mukhateer al-mahala and tribal leaders) will have more legitimacy than Misrata MC, Sirte MC, or Sirte local councils, as these local leaders are closest to and most familiar to residents. They should be in the lead in public outreach efforts.- Residents in Abu Grain and Wishka are receptive to Misrata participation in these activities in their areas.- All of the relevant stakeholders are interested in participating in a cooperative process to address service delivery and recovery needs, and it is important to assess the level of cooperation among these actors for future activities.- LTI assumes we will be able to view and assess the cooperative process during implementation.- LTI assumes residents of Abu Grain and Wishka will see the cooperation through the public outreach.- The project is high visibility and high priority for families in Abu Grain and Wishka.

At the beginning of 2016, Libya’s political future is more uncertain than at any time since the 2011 revolution. Political division, armed conflict and a crisis of legitimacy at the national level have accelerated the fragmentation of Libya’s governance landscape. Regional coalitions which formed in 2014 have fractured during 2015 and cities and municipalities have become increasingly isolated. Libya’s two nominal national governments both exert little authority outside their respective bases in Tripoli and Tobruk. The political elites involved in the UN-sponsored dialogue to form a unity government lack legitimacy and the country lacks a national political leadership that can claim a mandate to negotiate a solution to Libya’s crises. The collapse of the national-level political process and institutions has shifted significant governance responsibilities to local formal and informal actors. Municipal councils are viewed as the most credible institutions, though they face serious challenges to providing services to their constituents. The collapse of state institutions and the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security vacuum to strengthen its presence in Libya.The Islamic State grew in Libya during 2015 as local jihadi groups pledged allegiance to IS. The largest group emerged in the Sirte promoted itself as the “Tripoli Province” of the Islamic State, taking control of a large area of territory around Sirte. IS took advantage of Sirte's Islamist and jihadist trends that have been active since the city's marginalization after the revolution. In 2015/early 2016, IS took full control and instituted strict observance of shariah. Sirte became isolated from the rest of Libya, leading to shortages of food, money, and medicine. Many of the town’s residents fled - creating a huge influx of IDPs to other cities along the coast. GNA forces (Al-Bunyan Al-Marsoos,) launched a military operation in May 2016 aiming to liberate Sirte area, and GNA military forces have recaptured all surrounding villages and most of central Sirte as of November 2016. One of those towns was Abu Grein and the satellite villages of al-Wishkah and Bueyrat, which have been occupied by IS for over two weeks during the fighting. This badly impacted its public facilities and left the local authorities paralyzed in delivering vital health and education services to the returning residents and IDPs still in the area, around 10-12,000 individuals total.As Sirte area recovers from conflict, extremism, and displacement, LTI 2 will work with these local authorities to improve two critical pillars of effective local governance – basic service delivery and public outreach and communications. According to LTI 2 research, these are the two factors most correlated with public confidence in local governance, and rapid progress in these 2 areas will be particularly critical for medium-term stability in Sirte area. Usually, municipal councils take the lead, but where MC leadership is unsettled, neighborhood councils, CSOs, tribal elders, and ministry representatives fill the gap. In Abu Grain and in Sirte area, many different formal and informal governance actors are now involved in providing services and humanitarian support – including sub-local councils in communities and neighborhoods (mukateer al-Mahalla), Sirte Crisis Committee, GNA ministries, tribal leaders, Sirte local council, and Misrata MC. There is a need to increase cooperation among these actors to address critical public needs and inform the public about the efforts of legitimate governing actors. As in other areas, LTI 2 will help facilitate relationships between national ministries and local actors in the Sirte area to strengthen the long term institutional channels for the flow of resources and technical capacity to the local level.  In this activity, LTI2 is assisting the ministries of education and health, Abu Grain community leaders, the Sirte crisis Committee, and Misrata MC with in-kind support for the procurement of educational material, furniture and equipment for 9 schools and 2 medical centers in Abu Grain and Wishka. Students have started to return to school in the Abu Grain area, but most schools and clinics were looted by IS during the conflict and Abu Grain is still under pressure to support IDP familes from central Sirte. In the schools LTI will assist with student chairs and tables, office furniture, learning boards, kitchen materials, stationary, ACs, Files/Wardrobes for documents and paper, carpet, water cooler, chairs, learning materials, tables, water pump for 1-2 schools. LTI2 will support basic supplies for 2 medical clinics – 1 in Abu Grain and 1 in Wishka. Medical centers needs include office furniture, kitchen equipment, stationary, ACs, Files/Wardrobes for documents and paper, fridge, seats, carpet. All equipment and materials will be non-technical/non-medical. Furthermore, LTI will support a number of public outreach meetings and strong public information campaign between local authorities (sub-local councils in Abu Grain and Wishka), representatives of IDP communities in these towns, National ministries (MOE and MOH), Misrata MC, and Sirte Crisis Committee. Given the uncertainty of the local governance situation, LTI's preliminary strategy is to promote cooperation among all relevant stakeholders – with GNA ministries and community (Abu Grain) officials in the lead - particularly on public outreach efforts. LTI will assess both the cooperative process among these actors during the activity, as well as public reception to the service delivery from these governance stakeholders.

Since the signing of the Libya Political Agreement (LPA) in late 2015, Libya’s political future is hopeful but fragile. A new Government of National Accord (GNA) is working to help the country recover from two years of violent conflict between regional political factions. Despite strong support from the international community, powerful spoilers – particularly in the East – continue to challenge the GNA. Also, entrenched disdain for national level governance and rapidly eroding quality of life undermines the GNA’s credibility. Meanwhile, municipal councils have assumed significant governance responsibilities over the past 2 years, and they are still viewed as the most credible institutions. However, they face serious challenges in providing services to their constituents and are disconnected from national level counterparts and other local actors. Finally, the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security dysfunction to strengthen its influence.

The Islamic State grew in Libya during 2015 as local jihadi groups pledged allegiance to IS. The largest group emerged in the Sirte promoted itself as the “Tripoli Province” of the Islamic State, taking control of a large area of territory around Sirte. IS took advantage of Sirte's Islamist and jihadist trends that have been active since the city's marginalization after the revolution. In 2015/early 2016, IS took full control and instituted strict observance of shariah. Sirte became isolated from the rest of Libya, leading to shortages of food, money, and medicine.

One of those towns was Abu Grein and the satellite villages of al-Wishkah and Bueyrat, which have been occupied by IS for over two weeks during the fighting. This badly impacted its public facilities and left the local authorities paralyzed in delivering vital health and education services to the returning residents and IDPs still in the area, around 10-12,000 individuals total. In Abu Grain and other areas in the Sirte region, LTI 2 is working to strengthen the conditions for stabilization and peaceful return of IDPs - including rule of law services and infrastructure, economic recovery opportunities, and psychosocial support. 

In 2014, Sirte’s MC was elected, but failed to both elect and have validated a mayor to govern the council. Governance of Sirte largely fell to the appointed local council and tribal elders.  The political void and deteriorating security situation obliged local authorities, including rule of law and justice sector actors, to recede from public service in the region while military forces engaged extremist groups. As a result, returning residents do not have reliable and consistent access to dispute resolution mechanisms, security reinforcement measures, and various administrative services that strengthen the rule of law environment. Thus, LTI 2 is supporting the return of rule of law authorities through refurbishment of public buildings, including police stations, courthouses, and similar structures from which civil governance and rule of law authorities operate. This work is accompanied with robust public outreach to ensure citizens are aware of the efforts made by local governing bodies to address the current vacuum by encouraging the return of rule of law actors.

In this activity, LTI2 is assisting Misrata MC (MMC) with in-kind support to refurbish Abu Grain passports office, the only official passports office in Abu Grain and Al-Wishkah area, to allow the Abu Grein local council (AGLC) and MMC to provide administrative and civil services to residents and Sirte IDPs. This includes providing the office (under Ministry of Interior) with furniture, equipment, security upgrades and communication access to the main office in Tripoli. Furthermore, LTI2 will support a number of public outreach meetings and strong outreach campaign to promote the efforts of the national ministries (MOLG and MoI), MMC, and AGLC to restore these services in the Sirte region. The grantee for this activity is the MMC, but AGLC will be the primary POC for LTI2 throughout the life of the activity.

Finally, the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security dysfunction to strengthen its influence.

The Islamic State grew in Libya during 2015 as local jihadi groups pledged allegiance to IS. The largest group emerged in the Sirte promoted itself as the “Tripoli Province” of the Islamic State, taking control of a large area of territory around Sirte. IS took advantage of Sirte's Islamist and jihadist trends that have been active since the city's marginalization after the revolution. In 2015/early 2016, IS took full control and instituted strict observance of shariah. Sirte became isolated from the rest of Libya, leading to shortages of food, money, and medicine. Many of the town’s residents fled - creating a huge influx of IDPs to other cities along the coast. GNA forces (Al-Bunyan Al-Marsoos,) launched a military operation in May 2016 aiming to liberate Sirte area, and GNA military forces have recaptured all surrounding villages and most of central Sirte as of November 2016. One of those towns was Abu Grein and the satellite villages of al-Wishkah and Bueyrat, which have been occupied by IS for over two weeks during the fighting. This badly impacted its public facilities and left the local authorities paralyzed in delivering vital health and education services to the returning residents and IDPs still in the area, around 10-12,000 individuals total. In Abu Grain and other areas in the Sirte region, LTI 2 is working to strengthen the conditions for stabilization and peaceful return of IDPs - including rule of law services and infrastructure, economic recovery opportunities, and psychosocial support. 

In 2014, Sirte’s MC was elected, but failed to both elect and have validated a mayor to govern the council. Governance of Sirte largely fell to the appointed local council and tribal elders.  The political void and deteriorating security situation obliged local authorities, including rule of law and justice sector actors, to recede from public service in the region while military forces engaged extremist groups. As a result, returning residents do not have reliable and consistent access to dispute resolution mechanisms, security reinforcement measures, and various administrative services that strengthen the rule of law environment. Thus, LTI 2 is supporting the return of rule of law authorities through refurbishment of public buildings, including police stations, courthouses, and similar structures from which civil governance and rule of law authorities operate. This work is accompanied with robust public outreach to ensure citizens are aware of the efforts made by local governing bodies to address the current vacuum by encouraging the return of rule of law actors.

In this activity, LTI2 is assisting Misrata MC (MMC) with in-kind support to refurbish Abu Grain civil registry office, the only official office in Abu Grain and Al-Wishka area that provides civil services to issue documents including birth certificates, land and property titles, family booklets and other registration documents required by the government.This includes providing the office with furniture, equipment, security upgrades and communication access. This activity will allow the AGLC and MMC to provide administrative and civil services to residents and Sirte IDPs. Furthermore, LTI2 will support a number of public outreach meetings and strong outreach campaign to promote the efforts of the national ministries (MOLG and MoI), MMC, and AGLC to restore civil services in the Sirte region. The grantee for this activity is the MMC, but AGLC will be the primary POC for LTI2 throughout the life of the activity.

This activity aims to increase target Sirte IDPs communities’ awareness of local governance and line ministries’ efforts to respond to their priority needs. LTI 2’s 2016 needs assessment revealed 70% percent of Sirte IDPs require psychosocial support to overcome the trauma of exposure to violent extremism, conflict, and displacement.  In order to achieve this objective, LTI 2 will support target schools in the Western and Central Sirte region to establish psychosocial support services. The DDGS activity will be in the form of a) a subcontract with a reputable Libyan provider for psychosocial support services and training and b) procuring services and materials to establish the “safe spaces” and to conduct an outreach campaign to inform families about services available and promote the relevant authorities' role to facilitate these services.  The provision of this assistance will contribute to LTI 2 efforts to strengthen confidence in the participatory basic service delivery process at the local level.

If local authorities and line ministries support establishment of psychosocial counseling services in schools in the Sirte region, then the target IDP community will recognize the efforts of the authorities to respond to priority needs.
Because (assumptions): 
1-       Psychosocial support services are a priority need. LTI 2’s needs assessment in October 2016 revealed 70% percent of Sirte IDPs and returnees require psychosocial support to overcome the trauma of exposure to violent extremism, conflict, and displacement.
2-       (Approach) Specialized training is necessary as teachers and social workers currently lack the skills to help children recover from displacement, violent extremism and trauma. Creation of “safe spaces” for delivery of this service is necessary as those facilities are currently absent. 
3-       (Approach) Strong public outreach efforts will inform families about the psychosocial support in the targeted schools and the role of the relevant local and municipal authorities to facilitate this support.

Since the signing of the Libya Political Agreement (LPA) in late 2015, Libya’s political future is hopeful but fragile. A new Government of National Accord (GNA) is working to help the country recover from two years of violent conflict between regional political factions. Despite strong support from the international community, powerful spoilers – particularly in the East – continue to challenge the GNA. Also, entrenched disdain for national level governance and rapidly eroding quality of life undermines the GNA’s credibility. Meanwhile, municipal councils have assumed significant governance and service delivery responsibilities over the past 2 years, and repeated OTI polling indicates municipal councils are viewed as the most credible institutions. However, councils face serious challenges in providing services to their constituents and are disconnected from national level counterparts and other local actors. Finally, the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State and other extremist organizations taking advantage of governance and security dysfunction to strengthen its influence.

Hometown of former Libyan president Qadahafi, Sirte residents suffered a year-long occupation by the Islamic State and mass displacement in 2015 and 2016.  Sirte also suffered neglect and marginalization as the “losers” of the revolution. According to LTI 2’s needs assessment in October 2016, 70% of Sirte’s IDPs require intensive psychosocial support to overcome the trauma of these experiences. LTI 2 has worked previously to support local governance bodies’ responsiveness to IDP needs, in coordination with national line ministries (TIP040 and SRT001). LTI 2 is also contributing to a joint Sirte response effort with the UK’s FCO.  
Through this activity, LTI 2 will support up to 7 target schools in the Western and Central Sirte region to establish psychosocial support services. This activity will initially target schools supported by SRT001 in Abu Grain and Al-Wishkah and will possibly expand to cover schools in other areas including central Sirte. The DDGS activity will be in the form of a) a subcontract with a reputable Libyan provider for psychosocial support services and training and b) procuring services and materials to establish the “safe spaces” in the schools for provision of this service, and to conduct an outreach campaign to inform families about services available and promote the relevant authorities' role to facilitate these services. LTI 2 will partner closely with the Misrata Municipal Council, Abu Grain sub-local council, Sirte municipal council, Sirte crisis committee, and line ministries, including the Ministry of Education, in identifying teachers and social workers and implementing the activity. The provision of this assistance will allows authorities to respond to the priority need.

In this activity, LTI 2 is supporting the Herawa Municipal Council to restore functionality to the harbor for use by the fishing industry. Traditionally, Herawa has been one of Libya's largest and most productive fishing markets, attracting fishermen and vendors from all over Libya because of the strong natural features of the harbor that facilitate fishing. However, when the Islamic State occupied Herawa in 2016, the jihadi group destroyed much of the industrial equipment at the harbor,depriving  many returning families of their livelihoods. Thus, LTI 2 will work with the municipal council to purchase and install industrial ice machines and refrigerators at the harbor, which will ensure that fishermen can resume their work. The Herawa municipal council will provide ongoing security and maintenance for the equipment. Additionally, the council will conduct a strong media and public awareness campaign to highlight the council's work in supporting economic recovery and get information out to the fishing industry throughout the region that the harbor's critical infrastructure is functioning again. By helping the municipal council to respond to a priority community need, this effort will contribute toward increased confidence for civilian governance in the East.
","
IF Herawa MC restores functionality of the harbor for the fishing industry, THEN the confidence in the MC’s response to priority community needs will be strengthened. BECAUSE:- The new equipment (industrial refrigeration and ice production) will enable Herawa fishermen to fish for longer periods of time to increase output, store fish longer at the harbor, and sell fish locally.- The harbor is a priority need relevant to the community. Fishing is one of the main industries in Herawa and was devastated by Islamic State occupation of the area in 2016.The area has good natural conditions for fishing and skilled fishermen.- Public outreach efforts in Herawa and beyond will inform both the fishermen, vendors, and the community about the rehabilitation and the MC’s role.

Fighting in Sirte has tapered off in early 2017, and Sirte residents who fled are starting to return to the region. One of the outlying towns is Herawa, 75 km East of Sirte center. IS occupied Herawa for a brief period during the conflict and looted or damaged many of its public facilities. Herawa Municipal Council resumed operations in June 2016, and since then many of the town's residents have started returning..In Herawa and other Sirte basin towns, the conflict decimated the local economy.  Public and private economic actors, vendors, and businesses fled Herawa in search of safety and stability elsewhere. Market, industrial, and commercial areas sustained damage to their equipment and infrastructure, further complicating the return of businesses. Islamic state fighters looted the shops and commercial facilities. As residents return, economic regeneration opportunities are an important part of return-to-normalcy, which the municipal council is well-poised to assist with. In Herawa specifically, the fishing is one of the key economic sectors, and the harbor is one of the biggest for the fishing industry in Libya, and it provided a very good income to the town. However, after IS gained control of the town, the refrigerators and the block ice making machine at the harbor were completely destroyed, depriving fishermen of their livelihoods. In this activity, LTI 2 is supporting Herawa Municipal Council to replace equipment in the harbor for the fishing industry to make the facilities functional once again. Herawa Municipal Council will coordinate with the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal and Marine Resources Office during this campaign. LTI 2 will purchase the key equipment inputs that will help the fishing industry in the town resume - industrial refrigerators and ice machine. The municipal council will maintain the equipment for the industry at Herawa harbor. This will help rehabilitate a key sector the town's economy and make it much easier for fishermen to do business locally. The municipal council also expects that the rehabilitation will attract other vendors and businesses back to Herawa also. In addition, LTI 2 will support the municipal council to conduct a strong media and public awareness campaign to highlight the council's work in addressing the issue and get information out to fishermen and the fishing industry throughout the region that the harbor's critical infrastructure is rehabilitated.

In this activity, LTI 2 is supporting the Herawa Municipal Council to revitalize one of the important components of the local economy - the Herawa Sewing Factory. The Herawa Sewing Factory (or “Productive Family Factory”) was established well before the Libyan revolution to provide economic opportunity for women in Herawa. However, when the Islamic State occupied Herawa in 2016, the jihadi group destroyed much of the sewing equipment at the factory to prevent women from using the factory and working. Now that Herawa area is liberated from Islamic State control, residents and returning families want to use the factory again to help create income for themselves. Thus, LTI 2 will work with the municipal council to purchase and install sewing machines and related equipment at the factory, which will assist 40 families in Herawa. The Herawa municipal council will provide ongoing security and maintenance for the equipment, supported by the ongoing fees that users pay to the cooperative for its use. Additionally, the municipal council will conduct a strong media and public awareness campaign to highlight the council's work in supporting economic recovery. By helping the municipal council to respond to a priority need, this effort will contribute toward increased confidence for civilian governance in the East.

IF Herawa MC restores the Herawa Sewing Factory to full functionality, 

THEN the confidence in the MC’s response to priority community needs will be strengthened. 

BECAUSE:

- The factory is a priority need for the community. Around 40 families/women in Herawa previously relied on the facility to help generate a source of income for their household and they want to use the facility again now that they have returned to Herawa

- Looting of equipment and materials is the main obstacle preventing the facility from operating, as the building itself is still in good shape 

- Users will resume applying the factory’s  pre-existing model for sustaining the center (e.g. users pay a fee or portion of what they sell) 

- Public outreach efforts in Herawa and beyond will inform families/women from Herawa area about the rehabilitation and the MC’s role.

The factory, managed as a cooperative in the past, has helped them produce various types of fabric products, in addition of helping them selling these products in local markets. According to Herawa Municipal Council, around 40 families from Herawa used to benefit from the factory. However, after the Islamic State gained control of Herawa in late 2015, they prevented females from going to work, and to make sure they cannot use the factory again, the Islamic State sabotaged and destroyed most of the equipment inside. Now, there are only 2 sewing machines out of 12 still working, and only 8 women use these machines out of the 40.Thus, in this activity LTI 2 will support the Herawa Municipal Council to replace equipment in the factory and make the facilities functional once again for the 40 families in the Herawa area who depend on it for income. Once the factory is running again and users are able to produce and sell items, the factory will be able to once again generate sufficient income for ongoing maintenance and management. The factory has a pre-existing model of users paying a fee or portion of what they sell to the factory for use of the facilities, and users are accustomed to this model to sustain the center. Herawa municipal council will provide ongoing oversight of the facility. In addition, the Herawa Municipal Council will conduct a strong media and public awareness campaign after the re-opening of the factory to advertise that this component of the local economy is functional again and strengthen public awareness of the council's efforts to respond to priority needs.

IF Abu Grain local authorities establish a job skills training center serving Abu Grain and Al-Wishka 
THEN Abu Grain residents and IDPs will have strengthened confidence in the Abu Grain sub-local council and Misrata Municipal Council's response to community recovery needs.
Because (Assumptions):
1.	Economic recovery is at the forefront of priority needs post-IS. According to LTI research, 45% of Sirte’s IDPs are unemployed (compared to 10% before displacement). 
2.	Due to disruptive conflict and IS occupation, the Sirte region has fallen behind in skills needed in the emerging and recovering local job market. The center, in consultation with stakeholders, will determine what skills are most needed and design courses to address these skills. 
3.	Residents and IDPs in Abu Grain and Wishka areas want to learn skills to help them seek and find jobs, and local authorities want to support this process. This assumption is based on an informal assessment LTI 2 conducted through information gathered from the Misrata MC, Abu Grain sub-local council, and CSOs in Sirte and Abu Grain. 
4.	(Approach) Strong public outreach efforts will inform residents about the establishment of the center and the role of the relevant local and municipal authorities to facilitate this economic recovery effort. LTI2 knows from FRAP research the combination of services with outreach messaging is the most effective means for building MC credibility.

IF the Herawa MC refurbishes the Al-Khaleej Stars Cultural and Social Club, enabling it to provide psychosocial support activities for children and youth,THEN the Herawa MC will gain increased credibility in the eyes of its constituents. BECAUSE:- LTI2 in-kind support will enable Herawa MC to provide a venue with services to address trauma experienced by children and youth who were exposed to conflict and extremism. - Psychosocial support activities were identified as a community priority.- Public outreach efforts in Herawa and beyond will inform the community that the HMC active in addressing a community needs.  --Herawa MC wants to address community priorities but lacks the resources to do so.
",Creating Resilience in Herawa through Summer Psychosocial Support Activities,"
WHY/ISSUE:  The Islamic State (IS) emerged in 2015 in the midst of Libya’s governance vacuum. A local jihadi group, Ansar Al-Sharia, pledged allegiance to IS in Syria and Iraq and established the “Tripoli Province” of the Islamic State by taking control of territory in and around Sirte, where Islamist and jihadist trends developed after the city was marginalized for its ties to former Libyan leader Muammar Al Qaddafi and its anti-revolution sentiment. By early 2016, IS was in full control of Sirte and its surrounding areas and instituting its strict interpretation of sharia law. As a result, the Sirte area became isolated from the rest of Libya, leading to shortages of food, money, and medicine.  Austere living conditions and fighting caused most of central Sirte’s residents to flee to other cities along the coast. In mid-2016, a primarily Misratan force calling itself Al-Bunyan Al-Marsous (ABAM) launched ground operations military operations to liberate Sirte and the surrounding towns from IS control, and the U.S. later supported this effort with airstrikes.  ABAM forces liberated Sirte in late 2016, and has violence tapered off in early 2017, Sirte’s internally displaced persons started returning.WHO/WHERE: Herawa, a town 75 km east of central Sirte, was briefly occupied by IS. As a result, it sustained damage to many of its public facilities and was heavily looted. Herawa Municipal Council (HMC) resumed operations in June 2016, and since then many of the town's residents are returning. Like the rest of the population in the Sirte region, Herawa’s population was traumatized. As part of its efforts to address the negative effects of this trauma on the community, the Herawa MC identified the need for psychosocial support especially for children.  HOW/WHAT: In this activity, LTI 2 will support HMC to refurbish part of  Al-Khaleej Stars Cultural and Social Club in Herawa and to conduct summer cultural activities that also deliver psychosocial support to children and youth. Rehabilitating this club is significant, because the club was used a headquarters during the IS occupation of Herawa.  LTI2 support will include one-month stipends for facilitators conducting cultural and psychosocial support activities, procurement of refurbishment services for the club, and procurement of materials and equipment. Materials and equipment procured under SRT004 will be used for this activity.

the Medical Center's ability to provide consistent, life-saving health
services. This is a critical need that has received widespread negative media
coverage, and has been identified as a high priority for the Sabha MC.

In addition, LTI 3
will support the Sabha MC in delivering an outreach campaign to inform
residents of the work and the cooperation between the Sabha MC and the Sabha
Medical Center. This activity will contribute to overall citizen confidence in
the ability of the MC to lead a participatory service delivery process, and
will increase awareness of local and national government linkages.
","
IF the Sabha Municipal
Council is seen to be effectively delivering critical basic services, THEN
Residents of Sabha will have increased confidence in the local government's
participatory basic service delivery process. BECAUSE:

(1) Departments of Dialysis and Nursery want to have
reliable working equipment, to effectively serve a critical health priority for
the public

(2) Residents of Sabha
and the surrounding areas want access to critical medical services locally so
they don’t have to travel long distances or forfeit the services altogether.

(3) The Sabha MC wants to support rehabilitation of the
health care sector to better respond to citizens’ critical needs.  
",Secure Stable Power in Sabha Medical Center,"
After the signing of the
Libya Political Agreement (LPA) in December 2015, optimism and hope reigned among
the populace, but in 2017 approval ratings of the U.N.-backed Government of
National Accord (GNA) are at an all-time low.  The GNA’s failure to
provide security, deliver basic services and manage the cash liquidity crisis
has destroyed confidence in its ability to effectively govern.  Field
Marshal Khalifa Haftar’s  Libyan National Army (LNA) exercises some control
of more than half of Libyan territory. Already firmly in control of the east,
the LNA seized control of most of the south in May 2017.  A
governance and security vacuum exists in areas purportedly controlled by the
GNA, while Haftar and his allies provide security but demonstrate increasingly
dictatorial tendencies in LNA controlled areas. 
 
With unresolved conflicts
at the national level, municipal councils (MCs) have assumed significant
governance responsibilities since their election in 2014, and they are still viewed
as the most credible institutions. According to recent LTI 2-sponsored
research, 55% of Libyans view municipal councils as legitimate. Yet, that
legitimacy is eroding, as most MCs lack the resources to provide basic services
and are detached from both national institutions, other local governance
actors, and constituents. LTI is supporting MCs and their partners to bolster
the two critical pillars of effective local governance – basic service delivery
and public outreach and communications. According to LTI 2 research, these are
the two factors most correlated with public confidence in local governance. To
promote government cohesion, LTI 2 uses local service delivery projects to
facilitate relationships between national ministries and local actors, strengthening
the long term institutional channels for the flow of resources and technical
capacity to the local level.  Sabha is the political and economic hub
of Southwest Libya - a region where tribal conflict, porous borders, and the
lack of governance and public security have contributed to instability in Libya
since the revolution. Communal competition has contributed to significant
tensions and led to frequent outbreaks of violence involving Awlad Suliman,
Tebu, and Gadhafa tribes. Still, the municipal council in Sabha has continued
to function with relative legitimacy. Under the process of devolution to Libyan
municipalities, Sabha successfully held local elections for the 7-member
municipal council in August 2014.
 









Nevertheless,
according to LTI 2 research from May 2016, 75% of residents are not satisfied
with the service delivery in Sabha - which has a strong impact on perceptions
of the MC's legitimacy. In this activity, LTI 3 will support Sabha MC
to address a highly visible service delivery problem– unstable electricity
for Sabha Medical Center, specifically in the Dialysis Department and Nursery
Department. This problem has been widely covered in the news and social media,
with the most negative attention coming at the beginning of 2017 when two
patients died because dialysis devices were damaged due to unstable
electricity. To help address this critical issue, LTI 3 will provide voltage
stabilizers to the Sabha Municipal Council to install in the Dialysis and
Nursery Departments at the Sabha Medical Center in order to support critical
medical equipment. The Sabha Medical Center is a national-level authority under
the Ministry of Health, so this activity will also support local and national
government linkages. Complementing these efforts, LTI 3 will support the MC to
deliver an outreach campaign to raise public awareness in close cooperation
with the Sabha Medical Center. This activity will be an opportunity for the
Sabha MC to improve service delivery in a vital area that is a high priority
for citizens, in addition to informing the public about the mutual collaboration
between the national level government and the MC.

STH003,Brack Municipal Council,Completed,2017-08-13,2017-12-30,96176.42,93509.74,"
The aim of this activity is to increase awareness among Brak residents of the Brak Municipal Council’s efforts to respond to critical service delivery priorities identified by the community, specifically through repairing potholes on the main road connecting Brak and the South to Tripoli and the North. LTI3 will provide in-kind support to the Brak Municipal Council to conduct maintenance and repair the potholes along 40 km of the Brak Ashati-Tripoli road, approximately 40 km north of Brak. The road is the most direct and secure route between Tripoli and all of the towns in Southern Libya, but it has fallen into disrepair in recent years and has been the cause of numerous car accidents and fatalities. According to the Libyan Ministry of the Interior, approximately 90% of all accidents between Brak and Ash Shwayrif (300 km) happen within this 40 km stretch of road. Repair of the road was identified as one of the most critical basic services for the residents and municipal council in Brak, and requires both national and local level support. In addition to the repairs, LTI 3 will work with the Brak municipal council to conduct a  public awareness campaign to highlight the municipal council, Ministry of the Interior, and Ministry of Transportation's efforts to address the city’s infrastructure rehabilitation and service delivery priorities. The activity will allow the municipal council to directly respond to citizens needs by resolving the road safety issue in Brak and help demonstrate their credibility as the local government entity. 
","
IF we support the Brack Ashati MC to rehabilitate for the main road to Tripoli, THEN we can help the MC increase residents’ confidence in the MC's ability to response to urgent public safety needs, BECAUSE:
1- The Brak MC wants to deliver services to their community and wants to build a relationship with their community.
2- The Brak MC wants to contribute to the safety of their citizens and all people using this road.
3- The rehabilitation of Brak-Tripoli road is highly visible, tangible project that all residents will recognize and appreciate.
4- The Brak MC will have strong coordination with the ministry from the beginning of the project.
",Brak MC Potholes Road Maintenance,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Fragile and poorly maintained infrastructure causes major services disruptions, which, in what used to be an upper middle income country, contributes to widespread anger and perceptions of marginalization.  Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, car jacking, and clashes.  Discussion of democratic transition is now limited mostly to elites, while average citizens speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival.  The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing unrest, angst and instability from crossing a point of no return.
Brak Ashati, in Southern Libya, is one of the few towns in the region that has experienced relative peace and stability since the revolution. As a result, there has been a sharp influx of IDPs moving to the area, with Brak absorbing around 30,000 IDPs - more than any other town in the South except for Sabha. The total population has grown from 70,000 to 100,000 residents, putting pressure on public infrastructure and basic services, including water networks, roads, and waste water plants. The Brak Municipal Council is working to respond to these new pressures and establish a relationship with residents by improving critical service delivery efforts that address priority community needs. Through discussions with residents, the Brak Municipal Council has identified several service delivery priorities, which include: (1) Providing 4 - 6 water pumps to improve water networks, (2) providing two generators for two water wells suffering from power cuts, (3) providing chairs and white boards for two schools, (4) repairing the Brak Ashati-Tripoli road which has been the cause of many accidents, and (5) creating a community center at Municipal Council office for citizens to share the ideas to improve public services. Municipal Council members have traveled to Tripoli multiple times seeking support from the national government level to address the public's concerns and rehabilitate essential infrastructure, such as the Brak Ashati-Tripoli road, but so far have received none.
Issue: The Brak Ashati-Tripoli road plays a pivotal role connecting citizens and towns in Southern Libya to Tripoli and the Northern region. There are only two main supply roads connecting the Southern towns to the North; the Brak Ashati-Tripoli and Al-Jufra roads. The Brak Ashati-Tripoli road is the most direct and secure route. The Al-Jufra road is not only 200 km longer, but also currently runs through areas that have witnessed heavy clashes over the last two years, including in Al-Jufra, where fighting has recently intensified between the Saraya Defend Benghazi (also known as the Benghazi Defense Brigade) and the Libyan National Army. Since 2014, part of the Brak Ashati-Tripoli road has fallen into disrepair due to lack of maintenance, making safe and sustainable transit unreliable at best. In addition, this road connects towns in the South to essential public services in larger cities, such as the Medical Centers in Sabha and Brak Ashati, as well as the Tripoli airport, which is currently the closest operating airport after the Sabha International and Temenhent airports were closed in 2014 and 2016, respectively. While the road is already paved, it's in need of maintenance and repairs to fill potholes which have been the cause of a large number of car accidents and fatalities just north of Brak. 
Why: As a priority identified by the Brak residents, repair of the Brak Ashati-Tripoli road with support from LTI 3 presents a significant window of opportunity for the Brak municipal council to respond to citizens needs and establish a relationship with residents. By supporting the MC's effort to respond to community demands, LTI 3 can help improve perceptions about their institutional effectiveness.
Who/Where: Municipal Council of Brak; a 40 km stretch of the Brak Ashati - Tripoli road that accounts for 90%of all accidents between Brak and Ash Shwayrif (300 km north), based on Ministry of Interior data.
How/What: In this activity, LTI3 will provide in-kind support to the Brak Municipal Council to conduct maintenance and repair potholes along a 40 km stretch of the Brak Ashati-Tripoli road, approximately 40 km north of Brak. Repair of this road was identified as one of the most critical basic services for the residents and municipal council in Brak, and requires both national and local level coordination. In addition, LTI 3 will work with the Brak municipal council to conduct a media and public awareness campaign to highlight the municipal council, Ministry of the Interior, and Ministry of Transportation's efforts to address the city’s infrastructure needs and service delivery priorities. The activity will allow the municipal council to directly respond to citizens needs by resolving the road safety issue in Brak and help demonstrate their credibility as a service delivery provider.

In this activity, LTI 3 will provide the Sabha Municipal Council with support to purchase four mobile office trailers, furniture, basic equipment, and stationary to improve emergency response and community services in four major neighborhoods in cooperation with the National Safety Authority. This activity will be an opportunity for the Sabha MC to improve responsiveness in a vital area that is a high priority for citizens, in addition to informing the public about its efforts to address community priorities incollaboration with the National Safety Authority. The National Safety Authority is the institution charged with providing national-level firefighting and rescue services, and administratively falls under the authority of the Ministry of Interior. Since 2011 the population of Sabha has increased dramatically due to rapid urbanization and IDP inflows. It has also emerged as an economic hub and key transit point for migrants and human traffickers.  Due to these factors,the effectiveness of emergency response provided by the Sabha branch of the National Safety Authority has visibly reduced.
","
IF we provide the Sabha Municipal Council with support through the procurement of four mobile office trailers, furniture, stationary and basic equipment in Almanshia, Algurda, Aljadid & Hejarah neighborhoods in cooperation with the National Safety Authority, THEN we will increase public awarenessin the Sabha Municipal Council’s ability to respond to critical community priorities in cooperation with national government authorities.
Assumptions:
1- We assume that the Sabha MC wants to provide better emergency services to their community and wants to build relationship with their community.
2- We assume the Sabha MC wants to contribute to the public safety of their citizens.
3- We assume that improved emergency services is a priority for the community.
4- We assume that the setting up four neighborhood emergency services stations is a highly visible, tangible equipment project that all residents will recognize and appreciate.

Sabha is the political and economic hub of Southwest Libya - a region where tribal conflict, porous borders, and the lack of governance and public security have contributed to instability in Libya since the revolution. Communal competition has contributed to significant tensions and led to frequent outbreaks of violence involving Awlad Suliman, Tebu, and Gadhafa tribes. Still, the municipal council in Sabha has continued to function with relative legitimacy. Under the process of devolution of authority to Libyan municipalities, Sabha successfully held local elections for the 7-member municipal council in August 2014.
Issue: Since 2011 the population of Sabha has increased dramatically. Residents in neighboring cities migrated to Sabha because it is the economic hub of Southwest Libya and was one of the few places with any economic opportunities. Sabha has also become a transit  point for illegal immigration, with many migrants getting stuck in the city along their journey to Europe. Finally, many IDPs from the region have moved to Sabha because of its relative stability.   . The National Safety Authority-Sabha branch continues to try to provide services to all citizens, but rapid population growth, expansion of the city limits, and and limited resources from the MOI, the National Safety Authority struggles to respond effectively. The National Safety Authority's inability to respond to emergencies throughout the cityhas been flagged by the Neighborhoods Councils as an urgent community priority.. Traffic accidents in the area are common due to poor road conditions and substandard vehicle maintenance. Additionally, even through there is a peace agreement between rival tribes, armed clashes periodically erupt within the city. Finally, due to frequent power outages, chronic fuel shortages, and rising crime ratesmany residents store feul inside their homes to avoid theft, leading to increasingly frequent and destructivehouse fires. First responders routinely take over an hour to respond to emergencies due to poor communication networks and non-functioning emergency operations centers.
Why: Despite the Sabha MC's positive standing within the community, according to LTI research from April 2017, 54% of residents are not satisfied with service delivery in Sabha, which risks undermining the legitimacy of the most credible elected governance body in the South. As a main broker of the current peace agreement between Awlad Suliman, Tebu, and Gadhafa tribes, maintaining the council's legitimacy contributes to its ability to promote reconciliation and stability in the south. . If growing dissatisfaction with the MC undermine its standing within the community as a trusted body capable of promoting progress and providing benefits to the community, , the current peace agreement could fall.
Who/Where: This activity aims to strengthen emergency services in Almanshia, Algurda, Aljadid & Hejarah neighborhoods of Sabha, though support to the Sabha Municipal Council.  These 4 neighborhoods have the highest population densities, include residents from almost every tribe in the region, and account for more than half of the city's population.
How/What: In this activity, LTI 3 will support the Sabha MC (grantee) to provide four mobile office trailers, furniture with stationary, and basic equipment in order to provide improved emergency services in four major neighborhoods -- Almanshia, Algurda, Aljadid & Hejarah, which have a combined population of approximately 120,000 people. This activity will be in cooperation with the National Safety Authority. This activity will be an opportunity for the Sabha MC to improve responsiveness in a vital area that is a high priority for citizens, in addition to informing the public about the mutual collaboration with the National Safety Authority.

Sabha is the political and economic hub of Southwest Libya - a region where tribal conflict, porous borders, and the lack of governance and public security have contributed to instability in Libya since the revolution. Communal competition has contributed to significant tensions and led to frequent outbreaks of violence involving Awlad Suliman, Tebu, and Gadhafa tribes. Still, the municipal council in Sabha has continued to function with relative legitimacy, after successfully held local elections in August 2014.
Issue: Since 2011, the deteriorating security situation, political divisions, as well as tribal conflicts greatly affected the health sector in Sabha. The main health facility, the Sabha Medical Center, was not easily accessible to many residents for the past few years as it is located on the south entrance of the city and close to the conflict-affected area. As an alternative, residents turn to the 13 local public clinics for their regular medical needs. These 13 public clinics in Sabha administratively fall under the Sabha Municipal Council (SMC), whereas the Sabha Medical Center falls under the national ministry. The Sabha MC lacks the financial resources to provide these clinics with the needed equipment and clinic supplies to meet the demand for diversified service locations. This has severely affected the service quality and delivery and resulted in increased frustration from residents.
Why: In the absense of national government action in the South, residents are looking to the municipal councils to be more responsive to their needs. Despite Sabha MC's positive standing within the community, according to LTI research from April 2017, 54% of the residents are not satisfied with service delivery in the city, which risks undermining the legitimacy of the most credible elected governance body in the South. If growing dissatisfaction with the MC undermines its standing within the community as a trusted body capable of promoting progress and providing benefits to the community, this major city in the South could be open to fragmentation or influence of spoilersbecause the MC is a major broker of new and fragile peace agreements.
Who/Where: This activity aims to provide clinic supplies to the 13 public clinics (Almahdia clinic, Sukara clinic, Almanshia clinic, Gorda clinic, Jadid clinic, Tayori clinic, Naseria clinic, Hajara clinic, Tanwaia clinic, Abdelkafi clinic, Medical Care Clinic, Imhemad Almogariagh clinic, and Godwa clinic) in Sabha that administratively fall under Sabha Municipal Council. These clinics serve all residents from all tribes in Sabha, and serve as reliable and accessible alternatives for routine medical services. This is critical especially when the Sabha Medical Center operations are affected by nearby conflicts.
How/What: In this activity, LTI 3 will provide Sabha Municipal Council with support to procure clinic supplies for all 13 public health clinics around Sabha and organize an outreach campaign including an opening ceremony and the production and distribution of flyers that highlight the MC efforts towards addressing a community priority. This activity will contribute to overall citizen confidence in the ability of the elected MC to respond to the communities' priority needs.

This activity seeks to accelerate early recovery and return to normalcy in Ubari, a town in Southern Libya that is recovering from almost two years of tribal conflict. The fighting claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians, forced well over half of the population to flee, and destroyed Ubari’s downtown businesses and homes. A peace agreement ended the conflict, paving the way for thousands of displaced Ubari residents to return to their homes. However, the truce is threatened by a shortage of services for the area. The residents of Ubari perceive the Ubari Municipal Council as primarily responsible for addressing service and recovery needs after the peace agreement, including waste management needs. Given the tribal nature of the area, the MC's shortcomings in responding to such needs will jeopardize Ubari's return to normalcy and increase the threat of renewed violence. With USAID/OTI support, the MC, in coordination with the public services company, will distribute garbage bins in the city center and provide cleaning suits, masks and gloves to garbage collection workers. The MC will launch an awareness campaign emphasizing their efforts towards recovery and returning to normalcy by improving the waste management services. This will be followed by a clean-up day, attended by Ubari MC members, local officials, and civil society activists, and with the participation of Ubari residents, to highlight the return to normalcy to residents and IDPs.

If Ubari Municipal Council improves waste management services, then a key recovery need will be addressed and perceptions of recovery will improve, because:
Assumptions:
1-We assume that residents perceive the Ubari MC as primarily responsible for addressing service and recovery needs after the reconciliation agreement brokered by the Elders Council.
2-Shortcomings in responding to service needs by the MC will increase frustration and jeopardize Ubari's return to normalcy.
3- The lack of availability of waste management services is a significant source of frustration among residents that is preventing a return to normalcy.
",Ubari Waste Management,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Fragile and poorly maintained infrastructure causes major services disruptions, which, in what used to be an upper middle income country, contributes to widespread anger and perceptions of marginalization.  Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, car jacking, and clashes.  Discussion of democratic transition is now limited mostly to elites, while average citizens speak in terms of securing essential services, ensuring basic security, and financial survival. The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing unrest, angst and instability from crossing a point of no return.
Located in Southern Libya, the town of Ubari is home to two rival tribes - the Tuareg and Tubu - who were pitted against each other in an 18-month battle from September 2014 to February 2016 triggered by a quarrel over fuel smugglers. This conflict is emblematic of post-revolutionary power struggles across Libya. The fighting claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians, forced well over half of the population to flee, and destroyed Ubari’s downtown businesses and homes. The conflict raged until February 2016 and ended with a peace agreement, paving the way for thousands of displaced Ubari residents to return to their homes. However, the fragile truce is threatened by warring political and military factions, weak governance, a volatile security situation and a shortage of services for the area, whose community members remain tribal and well armed. 
Issue: The Ubari Municipal Council (MC) was elected in 2014, shortly before the conflict began. The fighting and displacement has strained the MC's capacity to provide already intermittent basic services, such as electricity, cell phone reception, water, and garbage collection. Although the municipality of Ubari and the UN Development Programme have assessed the damage, little assistance has been received and these problems remain largely unaddressed - increasing the threat of renewed violence. Now that citizens have begun to return, it is necessary that the MC play a key role in the town's recovery and return to normalcy. Poor waste management has emerged as a key community need, as a lack of collection services and garbage containers  has resulted in garbage accumulation on the streets and the spread of diseases, hindering a sense of recovery. 
Why: Waste management is considered a top priority for the community in Ubari. The Ubari MC and UNDP identified the lack of garbage containers as a key constraint to improved waste management. However, the MC faces challenges to the delivery of effective waste management services, primarily due to lack of resources. Ubari MC wants to return to normalcy, including by providing critical services to the community, but lacks the resources to do so.
Who/Where: This activity aims to support Ubari Municipal Council, as the primary provider of public services in the community, address the garbage problem by improving the waste management services in central Ubari.  The MC will work closely with the Public Services Company to implement this activity. The Public Services Company is a public company owned by the government that works under MC authority and is responsible for delivering basic public services in the municipality.  
How/What: With support from USAID/OTI, the Ubari MC, in coordination with the Public Services Company, will distribute garbage bins in the city center and provide cleaning suits, masks and gloves to garbage collection workers. The MC will also launch an awareness campaign consisting of informative posters about the waste management initiative to emphasize its recovery efforts and strides toward a return to normalcy. Following the awareness campaign, the MC will host a clean-up day in the presence of the MC members, local officials, scouts and other civil society actors and with the participation of Ubari residents to highlight the return to normal to residents and IDPs. By supporting this activity, USAID/OTI will contribute to accelerating the early recovery and return to normalcy in Ubari.

The fighting claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians, forced well over half of the population to flee, and destroyed Ubari’s downtown businesses and homes. A peace agreement ended the conflict, paving the way for thousands of displaced Ubari residents to return to their homes. However, the truce is threatened by a shortage of services for the area. The residents of Ubari perceive the Ubari Municipal Council as primarily responsible for addressing service and recovery needs after the peace agreement, including street lighting and signs needs. Given the tribal nature of the area, the MC's shortcomings in responding to such needs will jeopardize Ubari's return to normalcy and increase the threat of renewed violence. In this activity, LTI3 will  support Ubari MC to install solar streets lights and traffic signs in collaboration with GECOL and the Ministry of Interior. LTI3 support will also cover launching an outreach campaign to raise public awareness about the project and encourage residents to visit the city's enter. This activity will contribute to USAID/OTI's efforts to accelerate the pace of recovery and return-to-normalcy in one of the most strategic areas in the South.
","
If Ubari MC installs solar streets lights and traffic signs in Ubari Center then, residents will be more willing to travel to and use the area,  BECAUSE 
- Safety concerns are a primary driver for residents' hesitation to travel to Ubari center.
-  Installation of lights and signs will be a highly-visible signal of increased security that can encourage more normal usage of Ubari Center, even if not all measures of insecurity can be addressed directly by this activity.
- Business owners will in fact want to keep their stores open later after lighting is improved; increased economic activity will reinforce signals of security and normal usage. 
",Ubari Center Street Rehabilitation,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Fragile and poorly maintained infrastructure causes major services disruptions, which, in what used to be an upper middle income country, contributes to widespread anger and perceptions of marginalization.  Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, car jacking, and clashes.  Discussion of democratic transition is now limited mostly to elites, while average citizens speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival.  The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse.

The southern town of Ubari is home to two rival tribes - the Tuareg and Tebu - who, starting in September 2014 were embroiled in an 18-month battle triggered by fuel smugglers. This conflict is emblematic of post-revolutionary power struggles across Libya. The fighting claimed hundreds of lives, displaced over half of the the city's population, and destroyed Ubari’s social fabric. The February 2016 peace agreement paved the way for thousands of residents to return to their homes. However, the fragile truce is threatened by warring factions, weak governance, a volatile security situation and a shortage of services for the area, where the tribal community remains well-armed. 
As a result of the conflict, Ubari Center faced a series of challenges that hindered the return to normal life. The center boasts major public institutions as well as a public market and various businesses distributed along three main streets: Ubari's entrance, University street and public space street. All government and public institutions such as the university campus, court, schools, civil registry, municipal council, public market, schools, etc. are located on these streets. Street lights and signs were damaged by the conflict and the poor lighting conditions have affected the security situation since residents do not feel safe and avoid the center at night. This has not only affected people's mobility but also the economic activity. Now that the conflict is over, LTI3 seeks to leverage business owners' vested interest in longer term stability and improved safety in Ubari center to reinforce momentum around recovery.
With support from USAID/OTI, the Ubari MC will install 160 solar streets lights and 405 traffic signs in close collaboration with the General Electricity Company of Libya (GECOL) and the Ministry of Interior. Following the installation, the MC will organize an opening ceremony to promote the project and its objectives of returning to normalcy. The event will engage representatives from the Ministry of Interior – Ubari Office, Ubari MC, GECOL, members of the press and media outlets as well as businesses. The grantee will place five signboards in visible places in Ubari and posters highlighting the same message. The Ubari MC media office will be responsible for advertising the project on the MC's facebook page and updating the citizens about the progress of installation and kickoff of the outreach campaign. By supporting this activity, USAID/OTI will accelerate recovery and return to normalcy in one of the strategic areas in South Libya.

Through this activity, LTI3 is supporting the Bowness Municipal Council and the Public Company for Water and Sewage with pumps and spare parts to repair the sewage system in Bowness. Bowness municipality includes three villages: Temenhent, Samno, and Zegen and is strategically located 30 km north of Sabha, Southwest Libya. The town is one of the main supply routes for fuel and goods to and from the northern cities. It is also one of the few towns in the region that has experienced relative peace and stability since the revolution. Bowness has seen a sharp influx of IDPs mainly during the conflict in Sirte, which has put additional pressure on already strained infrastructure and public services such as water networks, roads, and wastewater plants.  As a result, Bowness suffers from major overflow of sewage in residential areas, spread of insects and diseases, and contamination of aquifer water. In response, LTI3 will provide in-kind support in the form of pumps and spare parts to reactivate the sewage network. The MC will also hold an opening ceremony and other outreach activities aimed at raising residents’ awareness about the MC and national authorities’ efforts to respond to community priorities. 


","
If the Bowness MC solves the wastewater problem by restoring pumping at the sewage collection station, THEN  residents' awareness of the MC's ability to respond to critical community needs will increase, BECAUSE
- Wastewater management is a priority for the community and improvements will be visible and widely appreciated
- We assume that Bowness MC wants to contribute to the public health of their citizens
- The awareness and outreach campaign will give the MC an opportunity to connect directly with their constituents

",Bowness MC Wastewater Management,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, carjacking, and clashes, and they now speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival rather than democratic transition. The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing angst and instability from crossing a point of no return.
Bowness municipality includes three villages: Temenhent, Samno, Zegen. The southern town is strategically located 30 km north of Sabha and is one of the main supply routes for fuel and goods to and from the northern cities. It is also one of the few towns in the region that has experienced relative peace and stability since the revolution. As a result, Bowness has seen a sharp influx of IDPs, particularly during the conflict in Sirte, which has put additional pressure on already strained infrastructure and public services such as water networks, roads, and wastewater plants. Poor maintenance and absence of spare parts compounded the problem. The only wastewater collection station in the area, which is located in the village of Samno, is currently out of service. Consequently, Bowness suffers from wastewater overflow in residential areas, which contributes to the spread of insects and diseases and contaminates aquifer water. The Government of Libya faces several financial, political and security challenges that hinder its ability to support the MC and the Public Water and Sewage company to solve the sewage problem.
The Bowness Municipal Council (MC) was elected in August 2014 and includes seven members. The MC has raised the wastewater issue to the national government, but the national government has been unable to respond due to political divisions and economic crises. As a result, resentment towards the GNA grew and in July 2017 manifested in a protest against a planned visit of five GNA ministers to Bowness in response to the lack of GNA’s support.
With support from USAID/OTI, the Bowness MC in collaboration with the Public Water and Sewage company will replace two existing sewage pumps that will restore the sewage collection plant to its initial capacity. LTI3 will also support the MC to hold an opening ceremony aimed at raising residents’ awareness about the MC and national authorities’ efforts to respond to the community needs. Attendees will include the Bowness MC, Public Water and Sewage Company representatives as well as representatives from local and national media outlets. Bowness MC media office will also advertise the project on the MC's FB page by updating citizens about the progress of the installation. By supporting this activity, LTI3 will increase Bowness residents’ awareness of the MC’s ability to address critical community priorities.

This activity seeks to increase awareness among residents of the democratically-elected Sabha Municipal Council's ability to respond to critical community priorities, thereby increasing citizen support for democratic institutions. To achieve this objective, LTI 3 will support Sabha Municipal Council to improve water quality in schools. A study on the quality of water and sanitation in schools conducted by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in partnership with the National Center for Disease Control and the Libyan Ministry of Education, during the first quarter of 2017 showed that 54% of the schools assessed suffered from inadequate and poor quality of drinking water and sanitation facilities, putting students at risk of health problems. Residents blame the national and local government for the decline in health services and openly voice their resentment, which if unaddressed can destabilize the legitimacy of the elected MC. With support from USAID/OTI, the Sabha MC will install water desalination systems and water dispensers in 55 schools across Sabha. The MC will also launch a public outreach campaign to publicize their efforts. This activity will contribute to overall citizen confidence in the ability of the representative MC to address their priority needs.

If Sabha Schools have clean drinking water, then residents will have increased awareness of Sabha Municipal Council’s efforts to effectively respond to community priorities because: 

• Provide clean water is a community priority.
• Wide community engagement of parents, students, and officials will provide a good opportunity for the MC to communicate their efforts to the public.
",Secure Clean Water for Sabha Schools,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, carjacking, and clashes, and they now speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival rather than democratic transition. The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing angst and instability from crossing a point of no return. 

Sabha is the political and economic hub of Southwest Libya - a region where tribal conflict, porous borders, and the lack of governance and public security have contributed to instability in Libya since the revolution. Communal competition has contributed to significant tensions and led to frequent outbreaks of violence involving Awlad Suliman, Tebu, and Gadhafa tribes. Still, the municipal council in Sabha has continued to function with relative legitimacy, after successfully held local elections in 2014. Tebu and Awlad Suleiman tribes signed a reconciliation agreement in March 2017 to end the hostilities permanently. However, the agreement is shaky, and the security situation remains volatile.


Despite Sabha MC's positive standing within the community, according to LTI research from April 2017, 54% of the residents are not satisfied with service delivery in the city, which risks undermining the legitimacy of the most credible elected governance body in the South. As a main broker of the current peace agreement between Awlad Suleiman, Tabu, and Gadhafa tribes, maintaining the council's legitimacy contributes to its ability to promote reconciliation and stability in the South. If growing dissatisfaction with the MC undermines its standing within the community as a trusted body capable of promoting progress and providing benefits to the community, this major city in the South could be open to fragmentation or influence of spoilers because the MC is a major broker of new and fragile peace agreement.

A study on the quality of water and sanitation in schools conducted by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in partnership with the National Center for Disease Control and the Libyan Ministry of Education, during the first quarter of 2017 showed that 54% of the schools assessed suffered from inadequate and poor quality of drinking water and sanitation facilities, putting students at risk of health problems. The study was conducted on 140 schools in western, eastern, and southern Libya did not result in any tangible projects to addresses the issue.

With support from USAID/OTI, the Sabha MC in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and the Local Health units will provide and install water desalination systems and water dispensers in 55 schools across Sabha. In addition, the MC will provide the schools with basic stationary packages including whiteboard markers, erasers, envelopes, A4 papers, etc. LTI3 support will also support the MC to launch an awareness campaign to raise residents’ awareness about the MC’s efforts to address their priorities. The activity will aim to improve water quality in schools while increasing citizen’s awareness of efforts by governance institutions to effectively address their priorities.

STH012,Libyan Organization Of Mother and Child Health and Safety,Completed,2017-11-15,2018-01-31,40927.26,41023.78,"
Starting in early 2014, Tabu and Awlad Suleiman in Sabha have regularly come into conflict . In March 2017, Tabu and Awlad Suleiman tribes signed a reconciliation agreement to end hostilities. However, the risk of flare-ups remains. Community elites like elders and tribesmen played a key role in brokering the agreement and have the most influence over its staying power.  Kaafel Alyateem Organization seeks to launch a campaign against violence (No More War and Conflict) to highlight the consequences of war to the community and tribes leaders and call for peace. In this activity, LTI will support Kaafel Alyateem’s efforts with billboards, A3 posters, A4 flyers, school bags, stationary, freezers, and refreshments. The campaign will include distribution of school bags by elites (tribesmen, elders, MC members) to orphans during a peace event that will emphasize the role they should play in peace keeping and reconciliation. The message will be echoed on outreach materials and media. Bottom-up pressure on the tribesmen and elders to uphold the peace agreement in Sabha will contribute to the strengthening of local reconciliation initiatives.
","
If Kaafel Alyateem launches a peace and reconciliation campaign, then elites will feel more responsible  to maintain peace and reconciliation because:
Assumptions:
1-	Those affected by the violence make the most powerful messengers
2-	The message of the campaign will resonate widely because empathy with orphans is shared across conflict lines
3-	Charity organizations have more credibility with the community than CSO partners, who have come to be seen as biased or political. Elites are well-known trusted figures that can work as peace and reconciliation keepers


",Orphans Support for Peace and Reconciliation,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Fragile and poorly maintained infrastructure causes major services disruptions, which, in what used to be an upper middle income country, contributes to widespread anger and perceptions of marginalization.  Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, carjacking, and clashes.  Discussion of democratic transition is now limited mostly to elites, while average citizens speak in terms of securing essential services, ensuring basic security, and financial survival. The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing unrest, angst and instability from crossing a point of no return.
Sabha is the political and economic hub of Southwest Libya - a region where tribal conflict, porous borders, and the lack of governance and public security have contributed to instability in Libya since the revolution. Communal competition has contributed to significant tensions and led to frequent outbreaks of violence involving Awlad Suliman, Tebu, and Gadadhafa tribes. In March 2017, Tabu and Awlad Suleiman tribes signed a reconciliation agreement to end the hostilities permanently, provide compensation to those affected by the fighting, and free all state buildings from armed groups. However, the security situation in Sabha remains volatile and violence can erupt at any time. 
The conflict has resulted in a significant number of orphans. These orphans are from diverse areas and tribes, and have been neglected by national and local authorities for many years.  
WHY/ISSUE: Political and community elites including members of the elderly council and tribal leaders enjoy the most influence over individuals and groups who engage in violence, and played a key role in brokering peace agreements and reconciliation. However, members of the community who have been affected by violence lack the platform and opportunities to pressure their representatives and key reconciliation stakeholders to peacefully resolve the local conflicts that frequently erupt. 
WHO: Kaafel Alyateem Organization is a local CSO established in 2012 that provides basic support to orphans through charity campaigns and collecting donations. The organization has good connections with the reconciliation bodies, elders council, Sabha MC, neighborhoods councils, CSOs, and orphans and their families. As a charity organization, Kaafel Alyateem, enjoys the trust of community members and elites, unlike emerging civil society organizations that are often perceived as politicized and/or biased .
WHAT/HOW: With support from USAID/OTI, Kaafel Alyateem seeks to launch a campaign (Let’s live all in peace. Let’s be life-makers)  calling for lasting peace   and reconciliation and urge various stakeholders to play a role in peace keeping and mediation. The campaign aims to highlight the consequences of war to the elites. This will encourage tribal leaders, elders, activists, local authorities, and CSOs to strengthen and support the reconciliation efforts The message will be clearly delivered through outreach materials, media, and peace event. The campaign will include distribution of school bags to orphans by elites (tribal leaders, elders, MC members) during a peace event that will bring t these parties together with other reconciliation stakeholders to emphasize the role they should play in peace keeping and reconciliation. The activity will benefit 100 orphans who lost their parents in the recent conflict and represent different tribes and areas across Sabha. The grantee will publicize the campaign through A4 flyers, A3 posters, and billboards  that will also be disseminated on social media and throughout the city. The grantee will also invite media to the event. By supporting this activity, LTI will support local actors to advocate for peace and reconciliation in one OTI’s strategic areas.

STH014,Ubari MC,Cleared,2018-01-16,2018-04-30,139077.44,0,"
This activity seeks to accelerate early recovery and return to normalcy in Ubari, a town in Southern Libya that is recovering from almost two years of tribal conflict. The fighting claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians, forced well over half of the population to flee, and destroyed Ubari’s downtown businesses and homes. A peace agreement ended the conflict, paving the way for thousands of displaced Ubari residents to return to their homes. However, the truce is threatened by a shortage of services for the area. The residents of Ubari perceive the Ubari Municipal Council as primarily responsible for addressing service and recovery needs after the peace agreement, including basic educational needs. Given the tribal nature of the area, the MC's shortcomings in responding to such needs will jeopardize Ubari's return to normalcy and increase the threat of renewed violence. In this activity, LTI3 will provide in-kind support to Ubari MC to equip four education facilities (Central Ubari School, Secondary Ubari School, Alwahda Alarabiya School) and faculty of law / Sabha University with student chairs, whiteboards, administration office sets, desktop computer and basic stationary. LTI3 support will also cover launching an outreach campaign to raise public awareness about the efforts of Ubari MC to accelerate recovery. LTI3 will provide logistical support and refreshments for the opening ceremony as part of the awareness campaign as well as the printing of outreach materials to promote the project.
","
IF: Ubari MC equips and  restores functionality to key facilities of the education sector in Ubari

THEN: public perception toward return to normalcy will be increased 

BECAUSE:

- Education facilities are one of the priority considerations for Ubari returnees

- Improvements to the education sector are highly visible, as most families have a family member involved somehow in the school system. 

- Community engagement activities will amplify signals that stability is returning to Ubari.


",The Way for Better Education,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, carjacking, and clashes, and they now speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival rather than democratic transition. The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing angst and instability from crossing a point of no return.WHERE: The southern town of Ubari is home to two rival tribes - the Tuareg and Tebu - who starting in September 2014 were embroiled in an 18-month battle triggered by fuel smugglers. This conflict is emblematic of post-revolutionary power struggles across Libya. The fighting claimed hundreds of lives, displaced over half of the population, and destroyed Ubari’s social fabric. The February 2016 peace agreement paved the way for thousands of residents to return to their homes. However, the fragile truce is threatened by warring factions, weak governance, a volatile security situation and a shortage of services for the area, where the community remains tribal and well-armed.The fighting and displacement has strained the MC's capacity to provide already intermittent basic services, such as electricity, cell phone reception, water, and garbage collection. Although the municipality of Ubari and the UN Development Program have assessed the damage, little assistance has been received and these problems remain largely unaddressed - increasing the threat of renewed violence.ISSUE: The Ubari Municipal Council (MC) was only elected in 2014, shortly before the conflict. But now that citizens have begun to return, they expect the MC to play a key role in the town's recovery. One of the primary recovery needs is education. The conflict destroyed several facilities. LTI has already supported some of these schools and Sabha University with equipment and rehabilitation support (see SAB020, SAB023 & SAB025). By December 2017, UNDP will finish rehabilitating three schools that were almost destroyed, but they will still lack basic furniture, making these schools unusable. In addition, the Ubari MC made repairs to the Sabha University Faculty of Law (based in Ubari), but with limited individual contributions, it still lacks basic equipment. Meanwhile, displaced students from these four facilities burden the other Ubari area schools and faculties.WHO: The Ubari MC is the grantee (in coordination with the Ministry of Education Ubari office), as it is the relevant authorities for service delivery per Law 59 on decentralized governance. Ubari MC is one of the most active councils in the South. Its seven members represent different tribes and districts, which makes it acceptable and welcomed by constituents. Targeting the education sector is both a meaningful signal of recovery progress, and also ensures wide public reach by the activity. There are 9,000 school children in Ubari and 2,000 university students. Most families have at least one student, teacher, or school employee, and any neighborhood contains one or two schools. Beyond immediate impact to the facilities directly supported in this activity, reduced strain on other educational facilities will be significant and noticed by the wider community. HOW: LTI will support the Ubari MC with basic furniture such as student chairs, whiteboards and office equipment for the three schools repaired by UNDP (Central Ubari, Secondary Ubari, and Alwahda Alarabiya), as well as to Sabha University’s Faculty of Law based in Ubari. Community engagement will emphasize a message of recovery and encourage students to return to their schools. Due to poor internet and weak media coverage, community engagement will be mostly in-person. Outreach to IPDs outside of Ubari will be conducted through the Ubari MC Media Office’s Facebook page. An opening ceremony involving the MC members, local officials, ministry of education representatives and civil society activists will emphasize the contribution of the school support efforts by the MC towards the city’s recovery goals. By supporting the resumption of education services at key facilities in war-torn Ubari, this activity will contribute to LTI efforts to promote recovery in strategic locations.

This activity seeks to support opportunities for communities and their local governments to work together, enhancing civic action to improve local infrastructure, reduce the space for extremists, and shore up government legitimacy. Following LTI’s procurement of 12 sets of playground equipment and safety surfacing, this will allow for the storage and transport of the equipment within Libya. When the political and transition dynamics are deemed appropriate, these playground sets will be installed at park sites throughout the country under additional site-specific activities. It is envisioned that the park spaces will be in areas prone to current/future extremist threats, high incidence of crime, and/or areas in which spaces for mixing and dialogue are limited. The site-specific activities will be designed around these parks, of which the installation of playground equipment is a component, and will create a space for men, women and youth from different tribes and groups to participate in positive, constructive activities. By engaging local government institutions and officials in the public events, these activities will boost opportunities for engagement between government and its citizens at a key time in Libya’s transition.

",Continuing to Strengthen Resiliencies & Open Up Public Spaces in Libya,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan
Government is taking some positive steps forward but there is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts.
Throughout Tripoli, Benghazi and Sabha, Libyans continue to suffer from the legacy of decades of under
investment and service delivery, creating a shared doubt in the political transition processes. In the summer of 2014, Misratan and Zintani militias staged large-scale fighting throughout critical areas of Tripoli, effectively turning the city into an active conflict zone. Meanwhile, as the birthplace of Libya’s revolution, Benghazi has become a symbol of the transition’s challenges. During the first quarter of 2014, nearly half of all recorded incidents of violence occurred in Benghazi. Open conflict between moderate forces under Hefter and Salafi groups like Ansar al-Sharia and the 17th of February brigade in the ongoing Operation Dignity military campaign continue to create instability. As the hub of southwestern Libya, Sabha connects the surrounding cities such as Ubari, Murzuq and Brak as a vital focal point, politically and economically. The city has seen several deadly clashes during the first quarter of 2014, yet, many of the obstacles are the result of underdevelopment and a lack of focus on the south from the central government.
Since the revolution, Libyan local and national government have struggled to deliver local development and practical projects with tangible outcomes to war-torn communities. This has resulted in a lack of confidence in the transition and trust in the government among a population scarred by skepticism after decades of Qadhafi’s rule. As a result, nefarious groups such as militias are filling the governance void and launching public works projects and charity campaigns to delegitimize the government, recruit disaffected youth, and promote radical agendas. Significantly, Libyans have stressed that a lack of social space have been a critical issue to bringing people together and moving the nation forward. Qaddafi did not allow for many social spaces for most of his rule and Libya has never been a nation, with communities divided before and during colonialism, a weak functioning state under the kingdom and divide-and-rule tactics under Qaddafi. At this time in the building of the Libyan nation, people will need to come together, and dialogue to forge a common national identity of what it means to be Libyan and what state structures will best provide for Libyan society. Therefore, in addition to the importance of boosting government legitimacy, increasing social spaces for interaction is critical to the nation-building process.
In response to these trends, LTI II is implementing clusters of visible, tangible community engagement projects that help to boost support for the political transition, bolster community security, and spark local- level change. By bringing together local authorities, civil society, and the community leaders to deliver practical projects like the establishment of community playgrounds, these activities aim to build relationships among key stakeholders and improve confidence in the transition. This project will continue the procurement and transport process, initiated in LTI’s TRIP128, of 12 sets of playground equipment. By supporting storage in Libya for up to six months, this activity allows LTI II leadership to identify appropriate moments in the political and transition context for site-specific installation activities to be developed and implemented. These activities will predominantly be focused in key population areas critical to the political transition in Libya.

",Southwest Libya Governance and Stability Assessment (SW Libya GSA),"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones, weak government performance, and active conflict are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. During the summer of 2014, Operations Dignity and Dawn changed the security and political landscape of Libya. The impacts of these local and national conflicts is still uncertain, but undoubtedly, the increase in armed violence has negatively impacted the perception of credible governance and stability throughout the country.
 
Chronic instability makes it difficult to implement key transition milestones, undermines the credibility of the government, empowers extremists, and has a chilling effect on civic engagement. Continued stagnation in the political process also compounds grievances, damages confidence in the transition, and creates space for spoilers to fuel additional conflict. In southern Libya, pervasive lawlessness and porous borders, the expansion of extremist influence, and escalating tribal tensions are all significant challenges to local security, legitimate local and regional governance entities, and a successful transition. 
LTI 2 has identified the Southwest, including towns such as Sabha, Ubari and Murzuq, as a critical area for future transition programming. Sabha is located in the southwestern region of Libya and is by many considered the “capital of the South.” With over 150,000 inhabitants, it is a hub for most activities taking place in southern Libya. Most of the trade coming from Niger, Chad and sub-Saharan countries also travels through Sabha. The city is home to Arab, Tuareg and Tebu tribes, but Sabha faces difficult inter-ethnic tensions, as well as a host of security and governance obstacles as a result of underdevelopment. Approximately 200km from Sabha sits the ethnically diverse city of Ubari. Residents are predominantly Tuareg, though the city also has significant Arab and Tebu communities. Ubari is the last major location before Ghat in the southwestern corner of Libya and is a connection point for many of the region’s oil fields and the various companies operating them. To the south of Sabha, Murzuq is one of the Tebu strongholds in Libya. Along with Tebu and Arabs, Murzuq also has, like many other southern cities, a sizable immigrant population from Chad and Niger. While the Tebu make up a small percentage of the overall population in Libya, they are a powerful minority in the South and it is important to engage with them.  
Currently, LTI has limited visibility on, and a depth of understanding about, events in the region. Significant activity in the southwest region of Libya remains under-reported. The region is underserved in regards to both traditional and social media. Media accounts of conflict between groups, for instance, often gloss over the underlying causes of conflict, as well as conflict mediation processes and actors engaged in defusing crises. The illicit nature of cross-border trade, smuggling, and extremist and radical activities, mean that these topics are rarely covered in the media irrespective of their importance in the area. Only a small number of Facebook pages and Twitter accounts regularly post material from the region. Due to these limitations, current knowledge generation processes are not providing sufficient visibility and understanding of key issues that are essential for LTI 2 strategy setting and program design.
In light the importance of improving knowledge about this critical area, LTI 2 has developed this Southwest Libya governance and stability assessment (SW Libya GSA) to obtain the information and analysis that will help LTI 2 to more effectively target, tailor, and monitor programming. The primary objectives of this assessment activity are the following:
1)	 Media Monitoring: Monitoring of local traditional and social media outlets in Southwest Libya to provide insight and analysis of significant events and topics of interest in the region.
2) 	Public Perceptions: Conducting snap surveys either face-to-face or by phone and provide analysis of public opinion in Southwest Libya.
3)	 Issue Research and Analysis: A robust Request for Research (RFR) mechanism wherein the subcontractor will leverage open-source materials in addition to quantitative and qualitative field data collection and validation to provide information and analysis on specific topics chosen by LTI 2 management.
The SW Libya GSA is designed to be an integrated, iterative, knowledge generation process incorporating media monitoring, public opinion polling, and a robust request for research process to support LTI 2 objectives in SW Libya. Specifically, the activity is designed to integrate several different fields of research (media monitoring, public opinion polling, and qualitative research) under one umbrella so that each field is mutually reinforcing. Successive rounds of research requests and surveys will allow the project team to refine its understanding of this complex environment over time, allowing it to develop better-informed and more targeted research objectives to guide the final report. This activity assumes that enhanced, granular analysis will enable L II to develop more focused and effective grants to bolster security and boost community development in support of a stable transition.

",Informing Program and Partners: A Mapping and Analysis Advisor,"
Libya’s post-revolution political transition has become derailed. Voter registration for legislative elections to the House of Representatives (HOR) in June 2014 dropped to 42 per cent of eligible voters, compared to 62 per cent in 2012 elections for the General National Council (GNC), reflecting growing disaffection at the political process. Subsequently, in July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli and its airport, with Islamist-aligned forces under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Libya Dawn associates in the HOR boycotted the new legislature and challenged its legality in the Supreme Court. Despite international recognition of the HOR, a rump GNC was resurrected and a parallel government formed. Each alliance has sought to recruit proxy militias, inflaming local conflicts and fuelling instability across Libya. Citizens have become the victims of this political-military competition and have diminishing faith in democratic institutions to resolve it. The country faces unprecedented polarization, with fears that it will split violently along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict. This resolution would provide the foundation on which to resurrect the political transition, the basis for sustainable peace in Libya.
The strategic framework of LTI 2 identifies the pillars of a foundation for peace in Libya to include the constructive engagement of youth in civic life, the impact of advocates of non-violence and dialogue on Libya's transition, and the importance of promoting viable alternatives to conflict. To appropriately program towards these objectives, it is critical for LTI 2 staff and partners to have a robust understanding of the Libyan context. With dynamics rapidly shifting, LTI 2 must redouble efforts to remain well-appraised of developments, in order for programming to remain well-founded. Additionally, as one of the few international programs to have remained operational in Libya during times of increased conflict, it is essential for LTI 2 to deliver well-researched and timely information products to the US Embassy and wider US Government. While targeted to USG audiences, these products will also contribute to the situational awareness of the wider international decision-making community.
This STTA allows LTI 2 to fulfill these needs through the hiring of a mapping and analysis consultant. Envisioned as an integral part of the LTI 2 team, this consultant will produce and oversee high-quality analytical products that will inform programming decisions and test assumptions on which strategic objectives are based. The mapping and analysis consultant will provide technical assistance to ensure that LTI 2 and its partners are able to collect, utilize and present the data necessary to make informed programmatic decisions and keep US Government partners informed about critical timely issues. The consultant will receive technical direction from the OTI Country Representative or designee, in collaboration and coordination with senior LTI 2 management. The consultant will receive contractual oversight from the LTI 2 Chief of Party or designee, in collaboration and coordination with senior OTI management.
This activity assumes that improved mapping and analysis will help LTI 2 and its partners develop more strategic and informed programmatic and policy decisions.

",Training Up: A Social Activism Training Advisor,"
Libya’s post-revolution political transition has become derailed. Voter turnout for legislative elections to the House of Representatives (HOR) in June 2014 dropped to 42 per cent of eligible voters, compared to 62 per cent in 2012 elections for the General National Council (GNC), reflecting growing disaffection at the political process. Subsequently, in July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli and its airport, with multiple aligned forces under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Libya Dawn associates in the HOR boycotted the new legislature and successfully challenged its legality in the Supreme Court. Despite international recognition of the HOR, a rump GNC was resurrected and a parallel government formed. Each alliance has sought to recruit proxy militias, inflaming local conflicts and fuelling instability across Libya. Citizens have become the victims of this political-military competition and have diminishing faith in democratic institutions to resolve it. The country faces unprecedented polarization, with fears that it will split violently along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict. This resolution would provide the foundation on which to resurrect the political transition, the basis for sustainable peace in Libya. 
The political space for social activism is rapidly receding in the face of violence and the progressive breakdown of the rule of law. High profile activists like Salwa Bugaighis and Tawfik Ben Saud have been killed in the course of 2014, many believe by violent extremists resistant to democratic principles. The stalling of the democratic transition has restricted opportunities for activists to engage in the political process and diminished hopes that Libya will soon achieve peace and prosperity through representative government. Many of Libya's visionaries have taken flight to neighboring countries and activists that remain are reluctant to risk their lives. The media has become increasingly polarized and discredited, further fuelling conflict and distrust.  The majority of Libya's citizens still aspire to live in a stable and prosperous Libya based on principles of inclusivity, consensus and representative government but are increasingly difficult for activists to reach and mobilize. 
Activists, monitors and journalists lack the skills and experience to apply themselves in the new operating environment in Libya. Specialist knowhow is required to minimize risks and maximize effectiveness. Hostile environment awareness, digital security and citizen journalism techniques are examples of the emerging requirement for operating in Libya. Equally, those activists who have fled the country may become increasingly reliant upon effective online activism to influence events in Libya. Activists’ training needs are evolving in response to ongoing developments in Libya and as they decide how to respond. Meeting the requirement demands a strategic approach that seeks to invest in participants’ skills over time, identifying suitable short courses that are tailored to their developing requirement and ability. This approach recognizes that one-off, short training courses have limited impact and that a more concerted effort to capacity building is required. The courses must respond to but also help to articulate the requirements for activists to work on and in Libya. Importantly, trainings must also provide networking opportunities for activists from different regions of Libya to broaden contacts and awareness of alternative perspectives, both Libyan and international. These networks should be nurtured through trainings and follow-up activities that can be supported by LTI 2. This demands a careful participant selection process that balances consistent ability and interests with the benefits of diverse groups. 
This activity assumes that, if influential advocates for non-violence and dialogue communicate more effectively and audibly, they will be better able to invigorate and empower Libya's moderate middle, overcoming those voices that promote violence as a solution to conflict.

Despite international recognition of the HOR, a rump GNC was resurrected and a parallel government formed. Each alliance has sought to recruit proxy militias, inflaming local conflicts and fuelling instability across Libya. Citizens have become the victims of this political-military competition and have diminishing faith in democratic institutions to resolve it. The country faces unprecedented polarization, with fears that it will split violently along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict. This resolution would provide the foundation on which to resurrect the political transition, the basis for sustainable peace in Libya.
To appropriately program towards its objectives, it is critical for LTI 2 staff and partners to have a robust understanding of the Libyan context. With dynamics rapidly shifting, LTI 2 must redouble efforts to remain well-appraised of developments, in order for programming to remain well-founded. Additionally, as one of the few international programs to have remained operational in Libya during times of increased conflict, it is essential for LTI 2 to deliver well-researched and timely information products to the US Embassy and wider US Government. These products may also contribute to the situational awareness of the wider international decision-making community.
LTI 2 intends to expand programming into important Libyan cities such as Ubari, Derna, Murzuq, and Bayda. Due to security constraints and/or geographic distances, staff from the Benghazi and Sabha offices cannot travel to these areas as frequently as needed. As LTI 2 expands its network and increases the number of activities in Libya, additional resources are needed to support activity development and implementation. Nuanced understanding of local level dynamics is also needed to support progamming and policy decisions. In addition, social media platforms are a key battleground of the Libyan conflict, requiring LTI 2 to enhance its online monitoring. In response to these various needs, under this activity LTI 2 will recruit up to four Field Project Assistants (FPAs) to support programming and reporting. The scope and geographical focus of each FPA will be determined based on the rapidly evolving needs of the program. Broadly, their tasks will focus on: data collection, analysis, activity generation, activity implementation and activity monitoring. Where security permits, the FPAs will be field-based. In addition, this activity will support the recruitment of a social media monitor. The activity is conducted as a DDGS in order to allow LTI 2 to cover stipends for the FPAs and social media monitor, as well as transportation allowances and any materials required to perform their duties. Other expenses may be included, dependent upon the location of assignment for each position. 
This activity assumes that improved situational awareness, activity identification, target actor mapping, and social media monitoring will help LTI 2 and its partners develop more strategic and informed programmatic and policy decisions.

",Discussing our rights! Supporting youth advocates to the CDA.,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s political transition is in jeopardy. Not only are slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement, but the post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility has created an opening for extremist elements that hope to truncate Libya’s political transition and violently impose on the Libyan people a regime based on a narrow interpretation of religious law. 
Starting in mid-May, there has been an escalation of conflicts and fighting throughout Libya. On May 16, 2014, an estimated 700 Benghazi Special Forces together with Khalifa Heftar forces began attacking Benghazi farms and the bases of extremists groups in support of Operation Dignity. The conflict soon spread to Derna, where there were several coordinated attacks against Ansar al-Shariah and other known extremist groups. The Operation has been supported by moderate voices in Benghazi, the east, and Libya in general.
Clashes between different groups broke out in Tripoli during that same week, while smaller-scale tribal
disputes broke out in the South. Although the violence in Tripoli did calm after a couple of weeks, it started
up again on July 13th, when militias from Misrata, allied with Islamist brigades, attacked Zintani armed
groups in and around Tripoli Airport, which has been an area controlled by Zintani militias since the end of
the revolution. The fighting escalated between an alliance of Misrata affiliated militias and Zintani affiliated
militias. 
The violence has resulted on a great polarization and division among the government different entities,  the elected parliament was split among people supporting one of each sides, either the Dignity operation or the Dawn operations, which made at least around 50 members of the parliaments to boycott the sessions in Tubruke which marked the first split among the parliament responding to the situation. As the violence escalated the General National Congress reassembled with a small number of its members to form new government to represent the Misrata Militias and its allies, at the meantime the boycotted members appealed in front of Libya's Supreme Constitutional Court about the constitutionality of the parliament sessions in Tubruke,  the result came out finally after several times of postponement to the unconstitutionality of the HoR, which complicated the issue even more.
The split created two governments, Hassi Government in the west & Al-Thinni government in the east, this situation confused the international community which made them to withdrawn their diplomatic delegation presence since the beginning of the violence, it also resulted of many countries to suspend their political transactions with both government as they received many criticism in supporting one of the sides.
Among this entire chaotic context, the CDA was the only legitimate body in Libya that made notable progress since those initial elections. It drafted its own initial internal laws, approved a process for communicating with the public, and has created committees to deal with eight thematic aspects of the constitution. The CDA have created a sort of ‘constitutional map’ that defines sources, chapters, references, and the titles of the constitution. The CDA was able to maintain its independence, which is of the utmost importance. On the other hand, major operations such as the Operations Dignity and Dawn pose challenges to the CDA’s work. 
On December 24, the CDA released their ""initial work"" on Libya’s independence day. The CDA has now given at least three weeks for civil society actors and organizations' suggestions and participation. At this point, activists and organizations have been highly critical of the quality and content of the drafts released by the CDA, but the buzz around this has generated a serious desire for many youth activists to reach the CDA members and make their comments known to the committee. This is particularly true in the area of human rights and civil liverties, where many activists can see their rights are under threat. However, the complex situation at this time has made this challenging, and LTI is seeking to assist youth to reach the CDA through a targeted workshop in Sebratha.
In this activity LTI will provide support for Nabed Libya to organize a roundtable discussion with around 15 youth civil rights organizations which will take place in Sebrata. The organizations will meet with members from the Human Rghts and Civil Liberties Committee of the CDA, to discuss the proposals for the constitution, and present the work that has been done by these organizations on these issues. The grantee has good contacts with the CDA and is confident that by providing transportation and lodging, he will ensure that the relevant CDA members attend. The results of the discussion will be presented to the CDA members to use as reference in drafting the final constitution draft.
This activity assumes that by convening a meeting of rights organizations from the west of Libya with CDA members, youth activists will have a chance to input into the constitution drafting process, and the CDA will take on board the results of their discussion for further consideration.

The areas impacted have grown to include Seraj, Qasr Ben Gashir, Ain Zara, Wad Rabee, Khalat Alforjan, Salah eddin, Hay Alakwakh, ad Abu Salim - in many of these areas, residents have fled from their homes. 
Throughout this increase in conflict, the cities and surround areas of Benghazi, Tripoli and Sabha have become more dangerous for those who publically oppose extremism and support human rights. LTI partners, including human rights lawyer and activist Salwa Bugaighis, and youth activist Tawfik Bensaud, have been two of many community leaders that have been tragically targeted. In light of this sustained and targeted campaign of violence and intimidation against those who express support for dialogue, human rights, and inclusive political processes and opposition to extremism and violence, support is needed to ensure that these moderate voices are not silenced to the detriment of Libya’s political transition. This activity aims to support civil society organizations and activists who promote dialogue, human rights, and inclusive political processes and build their capacity to operate safely and effectively in Libya. 
Recognizing the fleeting nature of windows of opportunities for CSOs and activists to organize and act within Libya, this DDGS will support the procurement of critical equipment resources to be delivered in response to future urgent requests of nascent organizations and activists. The intention of this material assistance is to promote the visibility and security of moderate voices that advocate for dialogue and reconciliation, build an inclusive sense of national identity and national unity, and build national and international pressure against violent extremism and for political dialogue in Libya. Illustrative activities that could be supported through the provision of these procurements include trainings for civil society organizations and activists on how to operate in insecure environments and promoting civic engagement and activism through media campaigns.

Libya's post-revolution political transition has become derailed amid increasing violence. Voter turnout for legislative elections declined 20 per cent between 2012 and 2014, reflecting growing disaffection with the political process. In the east, Operation Dignity was launched in May 2014 to root out extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments have formed, in alignment with these precarious alliances. Each side has sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya's lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fuelling instability across Libya. This has created a conducive environment for criminals and extremists to recruit and operate. The country faces increasing polarization, including fears that it could split along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.
The western region of Libya is socially and politically organised around its towns, many of which played a key role in the 2011 revolution. The region is principally inhabited by Arabs but the Amazigh people are a significant minority, concentrated in the towns of the Nafusa Mountains and long marginalized by Arab rule. The towns of the west are bound in a web of historical alliances and enmities that were exacerbated by Gaddafi's rule and again by his overthrow. Since the revolution, the towns' militias have competed for control of the national capital, Tripoli, home to more than one million of Libya's 6.25 million people. The western town of Misrata dominates the Libya Dawn alliance and has imposed its authority on the capital since July 2014, when it drove out forces aligned with the town of Zintan and later with Operation Dignity. Defying the outcome of the June 2014 legislative elections, Dawn politicians re-established the defunct General National Congress (GNC) and formed an unrecognized government in Tripoli. Despite initially delivering improved security and basic services, Dawn militias have struggled to maintain these improvements while expanding the conflict against Zintan and its affiliates. Battle lines have oscillated along the foothills of the Nafusa Mountains as well as the coastal region west of Tripoli, drawing many western towns into the conflict. 
Throughout this increase in conflict, Libya has become more dangerous for moderate voices and activists who publicly oppose extremism and support human rights, dialogue, and reconciliation. LTI partners, including human rights lawyer and activist Salwa Bugaighis, and youth activist Tawfik Bensaud, have been two of many community leaders that have been tragically targeted. In light of this sustained and targeted campaign of violence and intimidation, support is needed to ensure that these moderate voices have the skills and security knowledge needed to continue to communicate effectively, audibly, and safely. 
National Support Group (NSG) is a Libyan NGO made up of a number of diverse Libyan civil society activists working on varying issues such as human rights, democracy promotion, economic development, and youth and women's issues. They have cooperated with national and international CSOs on various activities and trainings. The NSG has also conducted a number of TV and radio debates and discussions regarding reconciliation, elections, the constitution, economic reform, investment, the rebuilding of Libya, the CSO community, and the challenges many NGOs face. Nisreen Adham is the Project Manager & Women's Team Coordinator for NSG. She attended an LTI Training on digital security and social activism in Istanbul in October 2014 under TRIP132. Under the current grant, Nisreen will be utilizing what she learned under TRIP132, in coordination with an IT trainer, to train other Libyan activists. 
In this activity, LTI 2 will support the NSG to conduct a 5-day training in Tripoli for two separate groups of Libyan women activists on internet and digital security skills to enable them to conduct their activism more safely. The training aims to equip these women with various tools, such as basic online security and safety skills, digital security and encryption programs, blogging, Twitter, crowd funding, and petitions. Participants will be issued with appropriate laptops and software. The training will take place in Tripoli and include 15 female civil society activists of different backgrounds who are advocates for non-violence and dialogue. It will target current and potential women activists who would like to receive training to advocate more securely but do not feel sufficiently safe to directly engage international organisations and cannot freely travel abroad.

This activity assumes that providing positive role models and creating opportunities that encourage constructive contributions for civic life will inspire young men and women to engage in constructive activities on their own, fostering increased commitment to civic activism. This is because Libyan youth have engaged in anti-social or violent activities partly as a result of limited role models and opportunities for civic activism.

Battle lines have oscillated along the foothills of the Nafusa Mountains as well as the coastal region west of Tripoli, drawing many western towns into the conflict.
The concept of civic activism is relatively new, as most civil society organizations and actors were established in 2011. Immediately following the revolution, Libya witnessed a surge of positive civil society registration, development, and activity - particularly among Libyan youth. However, as progress in Libya's transition has stalled over the past 1-2 years, youth civil society actors have increasingly become discouraged with the lack of progress they have seen in the democratic process. They also see the role of civil society being encroached upon by extremist voices and a highly polarized political context split between Libya Dawn and Dignity. Moreover, the escalating threats against independent civil society activists, with regards to their security, movement, and freedom of speech, is severely curtailing the attraction of civic activism for youth. With the rise of extremist influence and opportunities to engage in violence, the civic movement needs a great deal of encouragement and support to provide alternatives for young people. With the numerous security, social, and governance problems Libya is facing at the moment, a functional civil society free of political pressure represents hope for Libya’s future and stability.
One of the strongest models of civic activism for youth in Libya is the Libyan Scout Movement. It was able to preserve itself throughout the four decades of totalitarian rule under Gaddafi, as it escaped the ban on almost all forms of independent organizations under the regime, mostly owing to its political neutrality.  Nevertheless, in the recent Libyan civil war, Scouts acted as front-line support troops for the anti-Gaddafi forces, and generally are seen as a positive force for national unity, voluntary spirit and civic engagement. They have led numerous awareness campaigns, cultural events, youth skills trainings, community improvement projects, and field trips to teach valuable life skills. Their dedication to local communities, relentless activism and positive outlook helped them earn broad appeal across the political divide and turned them into genuine role models for youth and credible drivers for democratic transition in Libya.
Leveraging this broad appeal of Scouts, LTI 2 will partner with Huna Productions, a film production company that focuses on issues affecting youth, women, and civil society, to produce films promoting civic activism among youth. Huna collaborated successfully with LTI under TRIP070 to produce three creative PSAs to promote national unity and reconciliation. The equipment donated under the grant was also used to produce a full-length documentary film “Freedom Fields,” featuring the formation of and the challenges facing Libya’s women football team. Some of these projects have tested the boundaries of Libyan conservative society and recently, many Huna members have had to leave the country due to fear of intimidation and attacks. While this forced Huna to opt for more discreet and subtle mode of operation, its young members are convinced that their work is now more important than ever. Despite some delays  caused by last year’s political conflict and the deteriorating security situation, Huna resumed working on the production of “Freedom Fields,” and continues to depend on the technical equipment that it received under TRIP070 to bring this project to the finish line. 
Under TIP010, Huna will collaborate with Scout Movement to produce, present, and distribute four inspirational films highlighting the Scout's activities. The primary target audience for the activity is youth in schools in Central Tripoli, Fashloum, Suq al Jumaa, and Hay Andalus, the Tripoli neighborhoods, some of which are heavily engaged in the ongoing conflict, serve as hubs for militia recruitment or have witnessed alarming levels of drug and alcohol use among youth. Initially, the films will be screened in at least five youth clubs, youth centers, as well as the University of Tripoli student union, all of whom will be active during the summer months. At the beginning of the school year in September, the presentations and film distribution will take place in the designated schools in the mentioned Tripoli neighborhoods. In addition, Huna will design and produce 5000 brochures and DVD with the film series which will be distributed to schools and youth centers across Tripoli in order to reach broader audience. 
LTI2 will support the activity by providing a range of video recording and editing equipment to Huna production. The equipment and materials, some of which will complement those donated under TRIP070, will enable Huna to implement this project, but also strengthen its ability to continue doing multiple projects that support civil society and moderate voices in the future. LTI 2 is making this investment because it envisages Huna Productions becoming an increasingly strategic media partner in LTI 2 that will either contribute to or implement numerous activities. As Huna believes in encouraging its youth members, this project will be managed through Muhaned Lamin, a young editor at Huna and an experienced boy scout. In this project Lamin will combine the experience he gained through the scouts' activities with his media passion to create these films with the aim of inspiring creative youth activism. 
This activity assumes that providing positive role models and creating opportunities that encourage constructive contributions for civic life will counter tendencies to engage in antisocial behavior and inspire young men and women to engage in constructive activities on their own, fostering increased commitment to civic activism.

This activity aims to foster public support for non-violence and dialogue across current dividing lines in western Libya by highlighting the cost of war. In order to accomplish this objective, LTI 2 will work with Associations of Wounded in multiple cities to record and distribute seven short dialogue advocacy videos featuring wounded young people from the current fighting in Libya followed by billboard campaign around western Libya. The videos will be published in social media platforms and some TV stations for a wider audience. The wounded youth will be chosen from different cites, but the activity aims to focus mainly on Misrata, Zintan, and Zawiyah - with Tunis as an alternate location. LTI 2 will be working with associations of wounded from these cities. These civil society organizations play a strong role in caring from wounded warriors, preserving links between cities on opposite sides of the current divide, and advocating for non-violence.

This activity assumes that the majority of citizens in Zintan, Misrata and Zawiyah believe that the cost in casualties does not justify the conflict. By highlighting this common cost, citizens will be more supportive of a negotiated solution to the conflict and more vocal in demanding it, putting appropriate pressure on their leaders.

In the east, Operation Dignity was launched in May 2014 to root out extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments have formed, in alignment with these precarious alliances. Each side has sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fuelling instability across Libya. This has created a conducive environment for criminals and extremists to recruit and operate. The country faces increasing polarization, including fears that it could split along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.The western region of Libya is socially and politically organized around its towns, many of which played a key role in the 2011 revolution. The region is principally inhabited by Arabs but the Amazigh people are a significant minority, concentrated in the towns of the Nafusa Mountains and long marginalized by Arab rule. The towns of the west are bound in a web of historical alliances and enmities that were exacerbated by Gaddafi’s rule and again by his overthrow. Since the revolution, the towns’ militias have competed for control of the national capital, Tripoli, home to more than one million of Libya’s 6.25 million people. The western town of Misrata dominates the Libya Dawn alliance and has imposed its authority on the capital since July 2014, when it drove out forces aligned with the town of Zintan and later with Operation Dignity. Defying the outcome of the June 2014 legislative elections, Dawn politicians re-established the defunct General National Congress (GNC) and formed an unrecognized government in Tripoli. Despite initially delivering improved security and basic services, Dawn militias have struggled to maintain these improvements while expanding the conflict against Zintan and its affiliates. Battle lines have oscillated along the foothills of the Nafusa Mountains as well as the coastal region west of Tripoli, drawing many western towns into the conflict.Associations of wounded and missing are among the strongest civic organizations in Western Libya. They promote non-violence and dialogue, have been involved in many peace initiatives, and represent one of the strongest links between cities like Zintan and Mistrata split between the two sides. Fundamentally, their objective is to care for the wounded that suffer from permanent disability due to injuries during the liberation war. They also work with communities to re-integrate these wounded people socially and mentally into society and help resolve some of the social problems surrounding this re-integration. They lobby the government for funds, as well as recognition for the rights of injured people. In this activity LTI 2 will support the associations of wounded people to produce and distribute seven dialogue advocacy videos featuring wounded young people from armed conflict. LTI 2 aims to particularly target associations in Misrata, Zintan, and Zawiyah because these cities account for the highest percentage of fighters and dominate much of the leadership and the decision making process on both sides. Tunis will be a secondary location for filming if access to Zintan is restricted, as the Zintan association has identified some potential participants in Tunis. Supporting these groups to promote messages of non-violence and dialogue will be a significant boost to their civic activism and help them reach a broader audience with their message for peace. The videos will feature injured fighters on both sides of the conflict advocating for dialogue and sharing their personal stories in an effort to highlight the costs of war. They will be published on social media platforms and several TV stations. A billboard campaign througout Western Libya will increase the visibility of the campaign.This activity assumes that by cooperating with associations of wounded to produce short videos featuring wounded youth, LTI 2 will be able to highlight the dark side of war, strengthen the voice of these associations for non-violence, and foster public support for non-violence and dialogue across current dividing lines in western Libya.

The western region of Libya is socially and politically organized around its towns, many of which played a key role in the 2011 revolution. The region is principally inhabited by Arabs, but the Amazigh people are a significant minority, concentrated in the towns of the Nafusa Mountains and long marginalized by Arab rule. The towns of the west are bound in a web of historical alliances and enmities that were exacerbated by Gadhafi's rule and again by his overthrow. Since the revolution, the towns' militias have competed for control of the national capital, Tripoli, home to more than one million of Libya's 6.25 million people. The western town of Misrata dominates the Libya Dawn alliance and has imposed its authority on the capital since July 2014, when it drove out forces aligned with the town of Zintan and later with Operation Dignity. Defying the outcome of the June 2014 legislative elections, Dawn politicians re-established the defunct General National Congress (GNC) and formed an unrecognized government in Tripoli. Despite initially delivering improved security and basic services, Dawn militias have struggled to maintain these improvements while expanding the conflict against Zintan and its affiliates. Battle lines have oscillated along the foothills of the Nafusa Mountains as well as the coastal region west of Tripoli, drawing many western towns into the conflict.

In Libya, the most senior civil society organizations were established in 2011. While some of these early CSOs have developed into strong and resourceful entities, many CSOs that are newer or are based outside Tripoli or Benghazi, lack experience and still depend on funding from either international donors or sometimes the government. Their lack of human and financial resources has prevented them from playing a constructive role in most of the critical issues in the social and political scene, particularly for those organizations outside of Tripoli. Moreover, civil society actors have increasingly become disenchanted and discouraged with the lack of progress they have seen during the past year in Libya's transition to democracy. They're witnessing the role of civil society being encroached on by extremist voices and a polarized political context. In response, many CSOs have realized the importance of providing the space and the tools for their counterparts and new established organizations to plan, conduct, and practice their goals independently. 

Al-Mubader Center for Capacity Building and Development is a newly established center based in Zawiyah. It has branched from Nabed Libya Organization for Charity Work, an LTI 2 grantee under TIP006. The center, led by Mr. Alhangary, aims to create a CSO work space and resource center and to provide guidance for newly established CSOs operating west of Tripoli. Mr. Alhangary and some of the Al-Mubader team are members of youth networks created by international organizations such as VNG International and IRI around Libya. They are well-respected among their peers and other CSOs in Zawiyah, Sebratah, Surman, Zawara and Tripoli because of their long record of civic activism. In conversations with LTI 2, many civil society leaders in the area, including the Civil Society Union in Sabratha and CSOs in Surman, confirmed the need for such a center to serve CSOs in this area and expressed confidence in the center's leadership. They also emphasized that having an active civil society center would build public confidence in CSOs and their role in advocating issues important for building a truly democratic society.  

In addition to working with youth, Al-Mubader has been increasingly involved in a number of projects involving municipalities. Most recently, the organization was a part of the activity funded by the NDAW and ICML that engaged 20 mayors at a conference held outside of Libya. Several representatives at the conference came from Zawiyah, Surman, Sabratha, and  Zawara areas and were selected by Al-Mubader. In another recent project, Al-Mubader worked closely with Zawara authorities on a leadership training for 10 civil society actors to support the Municipal Council performing its functions, and advocate on behalf of Amazigh. Since boycotting the CDA elections over the role of the Amazigh language, the city has been politically isolated. The Zawara Mayor believes that the Council alone would not be able to lead the change in the Amazigh society, unless it is surrounded with strong civil society actors advocating the rights for Amazigh and their better inclusion in the new constitution. The mayor strongly supports the establishment of the Center and believes that it would provide CSOs, as well as the towns from this area, a platform for more constructive engagement in the political and social life of the country. LTI 2 sees the center as a platform for future activities with civil society and local government in coastal area west of Tripoli.  

Al-Mubader's highly visible activities and their relentless engagement with the leadership of towns west of Tripoli made Mr. Alhangary a well-respected and credible figure among councils in this area. Therefore, LTI 2 believes that supporting Al-Mubader Center in Zawiyah will not only open a window of opportunity towards empowering young leaders, but also invigorate CSOs in this largely neglected area, to expand their initiatives and re-engage in the political process. In addition, this activity would enable LTI 2 to increase its presence in this strategic region and contribute to efforts to create better connections between Zawara and Tripoli. 

The activity will support the setup of Al-Mubader offices with furniture and equipment in order to provide a suitable work space for conducting training courses, civil activities and campaigns, and to help build network for civil society actors in Zawiyah and the surrounding towns, including Sabratha, Surman and Zawara. The center will conduct an opening ceremony to announce the start of its operation and gather local CSOs in order to assess their needs and plans and understand how to serve them more effectively.

This activity assumes that an active CSO Center would mobilize civil society actors and create space for them to expand initiatives advocating for peaceful dialogue and more representative government to ensure they reach wider and more diverse constituency.

This activity will provide the staff of the Libyan Center for Freedom of the Press with equipment and skills to credibly monitor and document violations against freedom of the press and disseminate accurate and unbiased information to the public and relevant authorities. To accomplish this objective, LTI2 will support the establishment of an Observation Unit for the Center, providing basic equipment and specialist training to monitor, document and report violations and ultimately to more effectively advocate journalistic freedom. One component of the activity will be a joint workshop for the Center staff and 20 prominent Libyan journalists on the fundamentals of objective and professional reporting on issues concerning human rights. The Center is based in Tripoli, but its approximately 15 staff come from all parts of Libya, including Tripoli, Benghazi, Baida, Sabha, Obari and Zawiya. 
","
The activity assumes that intensive and targeted training on the fundamentals of freedom of expression and the skills required for objective journalism will provide the only Libyan media watch dog with the capacity and critical skills to effectively advocate higher professional standards and credibly record and document violations. It further assumes that higher professional standards in media and impartial reporting will support democratic transition in Libya. 
",Media Watchdog in Action! Supporting Freedom of Expression in Libya.,"
Libya’s post-revolution political transition became derailed in 2014. In the east, Operation Dignity was launched in May 2014 to root out extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all-out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments formed in alignment with these alliances, increasing polarization and raising fears that Libya could split along regional lines. Each side sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fueling instability across Libya. More recently, conflict fatigue has set it in, prompting popular calls for peace. A fragile, UN-sponsored peace agreement was signed by some parties to the conflict in Morocco in July 2015 while local reconciliation initiatives have proliferated in western Libya. Powerful spoilers remain outside of these agreements, making the immediate future unclear.

In this environment, the freedom of speech, and balanced media coverage of current events in Libya has grown very limited. Moderate voices supporting dialogue and peace face significant challenges on multiple fronts. As the Libya Dawn versus Dignity divide has become more entrenched, media outlets and journalists have felt pressure to align with one side. This polarization has resulted in biased or tendentious reporting that only exacerbated the conflict and fed public distrust of television channels and social media. Some outlets have been turned into propaganda megaphones for those in power. Other media outlets have been used to incite xenophobic hatred and violence against political opponents, minorities and other vulnerable groups. In post-revolution Libya, media often abuse the privacy and integrity of ordinary people through careless reporting and sensationalism thereby causing considerable damage to individuals. Professional balanced journalists are now operating in a significantly reduced space for objective reporting and face increased restrictions on free speech and pressure to openly align with one or the other political side. As momentum has developed in support of peace, there is an opportunity for the media to play a more positive role in support of dialogue and unity. 

Under such circumstances, there is a strong need to generate greater awareness of freedom of expression issues and build capacity of key stakeholders, including media practitioners and ombudsman organizations, to engage in a way which promotes and protects freedom of expression and journalistic professional integrity. In this grant, LTI2 will provide the staff of the Libyan Center for Freedom of the Press with physical resources and critical capacity to credibly monitor and document violations against freedom of the press and disseminate accurate and unbiased information to public and relevant authorities. In particular, the activity will support the establishment of an Observation Unit for the Center, providing basic equipment as well as training to monitor and document violations and produce and disseminate reports to more effectively advocate journalistic freedom. These reports are envisaged to serve as credible sources of information for domestic and international organizations and as a means to advocate higher professional standards in Libyan media. 

The Center, which has been operating since 2014, is based in Tripoli, but its members, approximately 15 staff, come from all parts of Libya, including Tripoli, Benghazi, Baida, Sabha, Obari and Zawiya. Its primary mission is to defend freedom of the press and promote journalistic independence through direct engagement with journalists and outlets, but also by issuing comprehensive reports assessing the state of media in the country. The Center's Annual Report for 2014 received significant publicity and was widely quoted by both domestic and international organizations, including the Human Rights Watch, OHCHR and UNESCO. The Center is one of the principal contributors to the UN-sponsored Universal Periodic Review (UPR) for Libya and a part of a coalition of organizations that draft specific sections of UPR relating to the freedom of the press and media.

The activity to support the Center will consist of three principal components: 

(i)	Training of 5 key Center staff and 20 prominent journalists from all parts of Libya on the fundamentals of freedom of expression and standards of reporting on human rights-related issues. The workshop aims to help establish the Center as a national media watchdog and create a shared online platform for the Center and the journalists to contribute reports and organize discussions relating to freedom of the press. The selected group of journalists represent some of the most popular electronic and print outlets in Libya and come from Benghazi, Baida, Shahaat, Tobruk, Misrata, Gharian, Tripoli, Sebha, Sirte, and Traghen. Several participants of the workshop will come from the popular TV channels broadcast from abroad, including Tunis and Amman-based Libya Watan TV, Cairo Libya TV and Amman-based Ahrar station;

(ii)	Skills-based workshop for 13 Center staff to monitor, record and document violations of freedom of expression and journalistic freedom, produce credible reports for domestic and international use; and 

(iii)	Provision of key office equipment to the Center to support its establishment of the Observation Unit and facilitate simultaneous monitoring and recording of up to 8 electronic media outlets with highest viewership in Libya.

The above workshops will be designed and conducted by the trainers associated with the reputable Tunisian Center for Freedom of the Press. The trainers, Yousuf Ahmed and Fahem Bouktus, pioneered advocacy for free expression in the post-revolution Tunisia. They co-founded or lead organizations such as Tunisian Committee for Protection of Journalists, Center for Freedom of the Press, Amnesty International Tunis, Arab Network for Freedom of Expression and the National Syndicate of Tunisian Journalists, and contributed to numerous books and publications on the state of media and freedom of the press. Their long experience in conducting workshops and dealing with issues concerning free expression and media in the neighboring Arab Spring country that faces similar challenges, but was successful in creating a vibrant human rights scene, makes them a good team to help strengthen the capacity of and empower their Libyan colleagues.  

This grant builds on past program efforts such as NAT001, TRIP132 and BENG041, to support moderate voices in Libyan media by building their capacity to communicate effectively and credibly. It is also linked to LTI's strategic support to Lawyers for Justice in Libya (LFJL), which will soon launch a campaign under TIP023 to promote a media code of ethics. The activity assumes that intensive and targeted training on the fundamentals of freedom of expression and the skills required for objective journalism will improve the capacity of the only Libyan-based media watchdog to credibly record and document violations and to more effectively advocate for higher professional standards of journalism.

TIP015,Wind Friends Club,Closed,2015-04-21,2015-05-30,4909.99,4909.99,"
This activity aims to promote water sports as a means of bringing together at-risk youths from different coastal towns in Libya in a sporting event. In order to achieve this objective, LTI 2 will work with the Tripoli Gargaresh-based club, Wind Friends, to bring together sister-clubs and sportsmen from strategic cities on different sides of the conflict, including Tripoli, Zliten, Zwara, Misrata and Benghazi, for a one day event to promote water sports activities. The Wind Friends club has a proven record of successful engagement of young people coming from diverse and disadvantaged background who are typically most vulnerable to the influence of extremists.
","
The key assumption behind this activity is that even short-term positive interventions to create space for young people can counter the strong sense of disillusionment among youth and provide them with a sense of purpose and the drive to positively contribute to the transition process. 

",Wind Friends – Sailing for Peace!,"
Libya’s post-revolution political transition has become derailed amid increasing violence. Voter turnout for legislative elections declined 20 percentage points between 2012 and 2014, reflecting growing disaffection at the political process. In the east, Operation Dignity was launched in May 2014 to root out extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all-out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments have formed, in alignment with these precarious alliances. Each side has sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fueling instability across Libya. This has created a conducive environment for criminals and extremists to recruit and operate. The country faces increasing polarization, including fears that it could split along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.

Youth in Tripoli are an under-served population, with few outlets for recreational activities, and a lack of positive role models for participating in the development of Libya. Youth played a key part in the revolution, however the proliferation of weapons, use of drugs and alcohol, and other forms of anti-social behavior has resulted in a concern over the potential role of youth populations as spoilers, or as potential contributors to crime or violence. There are increasing concerns that extremist influences are gaining a foothold in areas around Tripoli and are likely to expand into the capital. Working with youth is consistently identified by Libyan ministries, CSOs and the youth themselves as a key focus area to support a peaceful transition. This situation has resulted in many creative initiatives to create positive spaces for youth such as the Wind Friends Club.

Wind Friends is based in Tripoli’s Gargaresh neighborhood and it specializes in water sports activities, including sailing, kite-boarding and surfing. Over the course of past the seven years, it has become a hub of sorts for clubs and water sportsmen from other coastal towns in Libya, but more importantly, it has effectively engaged volatile and disadvantaged youth into various activities on water. Because of the typically expensive high-tech equipment, water sports tend to be elite and have less than a popular appeal. However, Wind Friends would like to change this and have worked actively to promote kite-boarding and surfing among the youth living along the coast from Zawara to Benhgazi, specifically targeting young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who are typically more vulnerable to militia recruitment, but also other forms of violence. In several recent activities, the club provided, free of charge, kite-boarding kits to dozens of young trainees who otherwise would not have been able to afford the equipment and helped them organize kite-boarding clubs in their towns. They also regularly organize and sponsor competitions to bring these clubs together and foster a sense of camaraderie that transcends the current political divide in Libya.

In this activity, LTI 2 will partner with Wind Friends to organize a one-day event to promote water sports as a means of bringing together sportsmen and at-risk youth from towns on the different side of the conflict. The event will take place in Tripoli and will gather participants from coastal towns of Zawara, Tripoli, Zliten, Misrata and Benghazi in an all-day fair aimed at promoting activities at water as an alternative to anti-social behavior that threatens many disaffected young people in today’s Libya. Wind Friends will also use this event as a networking opportunity to link up sportsmen from different coastal communities and create space and opportunities for future cooperation. LTI 2 envisages further activities with the grantee if this trial event indicates the potential of water sports to reach a wider audience of youths.

To support the club in its efforts, LTI 2 will fund the organization of the one-day event to bring together around fifty participants, some of them new to these sports, from the five key coastal cities. The event will include a friendly competition in several different sports on water and lessons in kite-boarding and surfing. The training would enable the new members to pass on their experience to other young people in their respective cities, but also create an opportunity for them to become parts of a larger sports community. Finally, the grant will fund a production of a short video featuring the event and highlighting the cross-city cooperation and the messages from the sportsmen. The video will be distributed through the club’s social media and other platforms.

This activity enables LTI 2 to continue its strategic engagement with youth through expanded opportunities for positive engagement in social and community life. This specific grant will target key cities on the opposite sides of the conflict which are known as hotspots for recruitment of militia and create space for greater interaction among youth across the political divide.

This activity assumes that even short-term positive interventions to create space for young people can counter the strong sense of disillusionment among youth and provide them with a sense of purpose and the drive to positively contribute to the transition process.

Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) is, under the direction of the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative to Libya Bernardino Leon, facilitating political talks to end the current conflict. UNSMIL is widely viewed as the only political entity with the international legitimacy and authority to mediate between the warring parties. The talks were first initiated in town of Ghadames in October 2014 between active and boycotting representatives of the internationally-recognized House of Representatives. Despite early pessimism, the dialogue process has of late inspired new optimism, expanding to include other influential political players such as a delegation of the rump General National Congress. The priorities of the talks are to establish a Government of National Unity, establish joint security arrangements, and keep the constitutional drafting process on track. In February 2015, the talks were relocated to Morocco with the agreement of the parties. With fighting continuing in various corners and the Islamic State capitalizing on the security vacuum created by the current anarchy, Libya urgently needs the dialogue process to succeed in order to reestablish the political transition. 
This DDGS establishes a rapid response mechanism that will enable LTI to meet appropriate and urgent requests from UNSMIL and UN members countries to support aspects of the ongoing UN dialogue process. The flexibility and responsiveness implied in the mechanism is necessary in light of the time-sensitivity and unpredictability of the talks. While initially to purchase airfares for 25 Libyan participants to the forthcoming round of talks in Rabat, Morocco, between March 19 and 24, it is anticipated that further requests to USAID for logistical and other support to further rounds of the talks may arise. After this initial activity, any future activities will first be approved by OTI. 
The DDGS assumes that the success of the UNSMIL-facilitated dialogue process between the warring parties is a critical step to establishing the foundations for a peaceful democratic transition in Libya.

Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.
Following the bifurcation of Libya’s national legislative and executive branches in 2014, the country’s municipal councils remain as its most legitimate democratic authority. They were established following local elections in December 2013. As stipulated in the Municipal Councils Law of 2012, cities of over 250,000 inhabitants elected councils of nine members while smaller cities elected seven member councils. The councils’ continual legitimacy was reflected in a poll of 1,048 Tripoli residents in October-November 2014 carried out by Altai Consulting with LTI funding under TRIP134. 72 per cent of respondents perceived the councils as having a great deal or fair amount of legitimacy, significantly higher than either of the national legislatures. However, following the slowdown and eventual halt in the disbursal of national revenues as a result of the national conflict, the municipal councils do not have resources to exercise their authority and establish credibility among their constituents. The TRIP134 survey recorded that only 1 per cent of respondents perceived the councils to wield the most authority in Libya’s capital. Bridging the yawning gap between the legitimacy and authority of the municipal councils will help to establish the citizen-state relationship and invigorate waning public support for Libya’s democratic transition. 
This DDGS will serve as a response fund to provide material and logistical assistance for quick-impact activities that aim to increase LTI 2 networks and partnerships with municipal councils throughout LTI 2's regional focus areas. Illustrative activities that could be implemented with the support of this fund include providing international travel expenses for LTI 2 program team members to attend municipal conferences, proposal-training sessions for council members in West, East and South Libya, and printing of relevant training materials.  These activities, ideally, will lead to grants development with municipal councils themselves or community groups that are actively engaging with the councils. As a result of such grants, the councils will be more participatory and responsive to the needs of their constituents, in turn strengthening their perceived authority among the public and support for a democratic transition.

In this activity, LTI 2 will support “For You Libya Group” to organize a half-day national women’s conference on the UNSMIL political dialogue. The conference will be held in Tripoli center, inviting up to 500 women, with a diversity of participants from different backgrounds and areas of Libya.

The talks were first initiated in town of Ghadames in October 2014 between active and boycotting representatives of the internationally-recognized House of Representatives. Despite early pessimism, the dialogue process has of late inspired new optimism, expanding to include other influential political players such as a delegation of the rump General National Congress. The priorities of the talks are to establish a Government of National Unity, establish joint security arrangements, and keep the constitutional National Peace Process Support Fund drafting process on track. In February 2015, the talks were relocated to Morocco with the agreement of the parties. With fighting continuing in various corners and the Islamic State capitalizing on the security vacuum created by the current anarchy, Libya urgently needs the dialogue process to succeed in order to reestablish the political transition.
Nihad Miteig and Naema Jebril were selected to represent women on the UN dialogue sessions, along with other independent representatives, Fadel Lameen and Nouri Abbar. As the dialogue efforts continue, the participants of UN Dialogue Sessions are working to create networks and lobby to gather as much support as possible within Libya. Nihad has been in contact with a substantial number of people through social media and meetings she conducts. Her most recent event gathered a total of 20 activists from around Tripoli which LTI2 team attended. Nihad spoke about the last UN Dialogue session and expressed her desire to reach out to as many women as possible to gather their views in order to communicate them back to  the UN sessions. 
 ‘For You Libya Group’ was established in 2014 and includes Civil Society Organizations from around Libya. The group has been involved in many activities supporting dialogue and Municipal Councils. Nihad is one of its founding members. In cooperation with the Network of Democrats in the Arab world (NDAW), they have facilitated and organized workshops on the important role of Municipal Councils and women’s roles in the Municipalities. The proposed activity aims to support the ongoing UNSMIL dialogue. For You Libya Group will organize a half-day conference on April 4  to share with a diverse group of women the dialogue progress and gather women’s views on the draft agreements. The invitees will be comrpised of known, influential women activists as well as women from all walks of life (activists, academics, and grassroots). This is to ensure that the event includes as many stakeholders as possible and broadens participation beyond a narrow network of established women activists. The timing of the event is to inform the next round of dialogue in Morocco, therefore it is not possible to transport large numbers of women from across Libya. Although participation will be Tripoli-centric, this will be mitigated by targeting key participants from other areas of the country. Future similar events are being planned in the south and east of Libya. The grantee will also ensure maximum media coverage of the event to inform a larger, national audience about progress in the dialogue. Feedback resulting from the conference will be shared by Nihad Miteig with the UN dialogue members in the UN Dialogue Sessions, which are planned to take place during the first week of April in Morocco.
The initiative was welcomed by UNSMIL, which believes in the important role women play in advocating peace and dialogue. Bernardino Leon, the head of UNSMIL, thinks that the conference would  be a ""great opportunity to send positive messages supporting dialogue and peace to the society’’. Leon will address the conference and deliver a short speech via skype. 
Through this initiative, the grantee plans to establish a database of women around Libya to idenitfy new leaders within the communities, especially among youth. The grantee is also planning to continue the efforts to meet with as many women as possible, the next step being  to organize a dialogue conference targeting broader groups of women in the south and east of Libya. They will use the logo created through this activity, hoping to feed the results into the next rounds of dialogue, because they believe that women could have a lasting and strong impact not only on the ongoing dialogue, but the society in general.  
In this activity LTI2 will help facilitate and organize  the conference in the center of Tripoli for around 500 women, including providing logistic support for 60 participant from eastern, western and southern Libya cities, and maximum of 440 participants from within Tripoli. LTI2 will reserve a conference hall, and provide the needed stationary for the conference.
This activity assumes that women are more inclined towards peaceful solutions to the current conflict than men and can play an influential role in building support within Libya for dialogue. It also assumes that, by informing women about the dialogue and giving them an opportunity to give their views, they will be more likely to advocate for the dialogue within their constituencies.

This activity aims to promote tolerance and open-mindedness through better understanding of Libya's diverse history. In order to achieve this objective, LTI 2 will work with the group of independent young activists from Nalut, Tripoli and Misrata to launch a website and initiate the publication of a monthly magazine raising awareness about the rich history of Libya and its diverse cultures. Under the leadership of a well-known blogger, Khalifa Alepeshpash, an group of young Libyan activists and bloggers with a keen interest in history have been promoting the country’s history and culture as a means of restoring the sense of national identity and tolerance. LTI 2 seeks to support this nascent community based organization to continue this work through the establishment of a website and magazine. The key assumption behind the activity is that a renewed sense of national identity and pride would restore public faith in peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflict and counter the current culture of intolerance and violence.

If public interventions emphasize diversity and positive aspects of Libyan history, culture and tradition then they will contribute to rebuilding the sense of common national identity and pride among the currently polarized groups in Libya, strengthen civic resilience and counter the prevailing discourse of violence. This assumes that increased intolerance among Libyans caused by Gaddafi's four-decade rule is a driver of the current conflict in Libya.

Under the leadership of a well-known blogger, Khalifa Alepeshpash, an informal group of young Libyan activists and bloggers with a keen interest in history has been promoting the country’s history and culture as a means of restoring the sense of national identity and tolerance. These young activists believe that the decades of totalitarian regime and the recent instability have caused  a sustained loss of confidence and eroded core values among Libyan people, created space for ethnic and tribal divisions and intolerance and increased the appeal of extremist ideologies. Their mission is to make history accessible and relevant for ordinary citizens, in particular youth, and raise awareness about Libya’s rich cultural traditions and long history of unity and diversity which are all but lost at the time of the current conflict. This activity is a part of a broader LTI 2 effort to support interventions that create positive opportunities for moderate voices and help restore the civic pride and public faith in peaceful transition.
In this activity, LTI 2 will support Alepeshpash and his group to launch a website and a monthly magazine on Libyan history and culture. The group draws contributors from different parts of the country, including Nalut, Tripoli and Misrata, and the plan is to engage historians and civic activists from other parts of Libya once the magazine is in print. Both the web site and the magazine are envisaged to have a modern and appealing design and will be accessible through social media in order to reach broader, but also a younger, audience. Under the activity, LTI 2 will provide basic materials, equipment and services to assist the start-up and will continue supporting the group for the duration of six months. Beyond the life of the grant, the Alepeshpash group plans to seek funding from government agencies and start selling the magazine for a small profit in order to support its operations in a more sustained manner.  For the time being, several Libya’s prominent scholars, as well as the editorial board, have committed to provide their contributions free of charge.
This basic assumption behind this activity is that public interventions that emphasize diversity and positive aspects of Libyan history, culture and tradition will contribute to rebuilding the sense of common national identity and pride among the currently polarized groups in Libya, strengthen civic resilience and counter the prevailing discourse of violence.

In order to accomplish this objective, LTI 2 will work with the grantee on recording, producing and disseminating a six-minute video. LTI 2 will partner will Nazik, a well-known media and production company based in Tripoli to develop both the song and video. The video will feature children - music school students – from all parts of Libya singing an emotive and inspiring song of peace. Children have great importance in Libyan culture and make effective messengers of peace and hope - contributing to a sense of positive Libyan national identity that counters current pro-violence messaging.

",Renewing Hope and Unity through Children's Songs,"
Libya’s post-revolution political transition has become derailed amid increasing violence. Voter turnout for legislative elections declined by 20 percentage points between 2012 and 2014, reflecting growing disaffection at the political process. In the east, Operation Dignity was launched in May 2014 to root out extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all-out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments have formed, in alignment with these precarious alliances. Each side has sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fueling instability across Libya. This has created a conducive environment for criminals and extremists to recruit and operate. The country faces increasing polarization, including fears that it could split along regional lines. Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.



The recurring fighting and the resulting political insecurity have caused a great deal of disillusionment among the population and undermined popular confidence in an imminent resolution of the conflict. Despite daily disappointments and declining national morale, the vast majority of citizens still believe that reconciliation is possible and hope for the quick restoration of normalcy. Recent polls conducted under LTI's Governance and Stability Assessment (GSA - TIP002) in Tripoli and Misrata indicated clear support for a negotiated solution to the ongoing conflict. Moreover, the series of recent local peace agreements between dominant military alliances in the West and the enduring cease-fires have provided a renewed sense of hope among citizens that reconciliation at the national level is possible. 



In response to these trends, and as a part of a broader effort to promote the principles of diversity, tolerance and national cohesion, LTI 2 will partner will Nazik, a well-known media and production company based in Tripoli, to produce a short music video featuring children representing all parts of Libya singing a song of peace. The song will include original lyrics and music written exclusively for this purpose and will be accompanied by the images of young singers and high-resolution photographs highlighting the country’s diversity – all edited into a dynamic video and audio performance intended to inspire strong sentiment of shared national identity and civic unity. Nazik has commissioned Naji Al Ghazawi, who has composed a dozen of Libyan traditional songs, to write and compose the song. The grantee believes that the emotive lyrics and the images of children, who are highly valued in Libyan society, are a powerful tool in conveying messages of peace and evoking strong feeling of national identity, especially during the upcoming holidays that bring families together. 



LTI 2 will support Nazik to commission an original song promoting peace and unity, including both lyrics and the tune, and produce and disseminate a six-minute music video consisting of children singing the song and high-resolution visuals of different towns and regions of Libya. The video will be distributed to traditional radio and TV outlets and social media to ensure that it reaches a broader audience during the upcoming holiday season.



This basic assumption behind this activity is that public interventions that emphasize diversity and principles of tolerance and unity, and leverage the important status of children in Libyan society, would contribute to a renewed sense of cohesion and shared national identity among the currently polarized groups in Libya and help restore pubic faith in and support for peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflict.

With LTI's assistance, the grantee will organize a series of three friendly football matches and bring together the mixed teams of players, consisting of famous veterans and new football stars from the clubs based in different cities across the country. The activity will take place in three different neighborhood in Tripoli at the start of the upcoming holiday season.  To implement this activity,  LTI 2 will partner with H2O – the program’s long-standing and trusted grantee (TRIP003, TRIP021 and TRIP051) and one of the most active youth organizations in post-Gaddafi Libya.

The key assumption behind this activity is that if popular and engaging events provide positive opportunities and encourage greater interaction between different communities, then they will help restore public faith and support for a peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflict.

",Fostering Unity Through All-Star Football Match,"
Libya’s post-revolution political transition has become derailed amid increasing violence.

Advocates of non-violence and dialogue must prevail in order to peacefully resolve the current conflict and resurrect the political transition.
The western region of Libya is socially and politically organized around its towns, many of which played a key role in the 2011 revolution. The region is principally inhabited by Arabs but the Amazigh people are a significant minority, concentrated in the towns of the Nafusa Mountains and long marginalized by Arab rule. The towns of the west are bound in a web of historical alliances and enmities that were exacerbated by Gaddafi’s rule and again by his overthrow. Since the revolution, the towns’ militias have competed for control of the national capital, Tripoli, home to more than one million of Libya’s 6.25 million people. The western town of Misrata dominates the Libya Dawn alliance and has imposed its authority on the capital since July 2014, when it drove out forces aligned with the town of Zintan and later with Operation Dignity. Defying the outcome of the June 2014 legislative elections, Dawn politicians re-established the defunct General National Congress (GNC) and formed an unrecognized government in Tripoli. Despite initially delivering improved security and basic services, Dawn militias have struggled to maintain these improvements while expanding the conflict against Zintan and its affiliates. Battle lines have oscillated along the foothills of the Nafusa Mountains as well as the coastal region west of Tripoli, drawing many western towns into the conflict.
The recurring fighting and the resulting political insecurity, along with the increasingly frequent and extended power cuts across Tripoli, have caused a great deal of disillusionment among the population and undermined popular confidence in an imminent resolution of the conflict. Despite daily disappointments and declining national morale, the vast majority of citizens still believes that reconciliation is possible and hopes for the quick restoration of normalcy. As the recent polls conducted in key cities across Western Libya indicate, there is a significant support for the ongoing UN-sponsored peace effort and a peaceful end to the fighting. Many civil society organizations (CSO) have recently started addressing political divisions and the weakened sense of national identity with creative and engaging activities that promote dialogue and unity.
In response to these trends, and as a part of a broader effort to promote the principles of diversity and tolerance during the upcoming holidays, LTI 2 will partner with H2O – the program’s long-standing grantee (TRIP003, TRIP021 and TRIP051) and one of the most active youth organizations in post-Gaddafi Libya, to organize a series of friendly football matches in three Tripoli neighborhoods. The matches would bring together mixed teams of players, consisting of famous veteran and contemporary football stars from clubs based in different cities across the country, for three days of friendly competition. Some of the players reside in Tripoli, while others will travel to join the matches on their own expenses. The players will wear jerseys with the names of key towns representing different regions, while the football fields will prominently feature billboards with messages promoting diversity, dialogue and the value of 'playing as a part of the Libya team'. Bringing together the veteran, as well as and young football stars from different locations, is intended to symbolize the continuity, but also highlight the strong connection between the two generations in their effort to rebuild the country. H2O believes that popular sports and events that enable interaction among different socio-political and age groups could serve as a catalyst for greater national cohesion and foster a stronger sense of national unity.
Under TIP022, LTI2 will support the organization of three football matches, and the production of outreach materials, including football jerseys, posters, billboards and a series of snappy video clips, all of which will be designed to increase the visibility of the event and reinforce the messages of diversity, tolerance, dialogue and national unity. This activity will enable LTI 2 to continue supporting a strategic partner and expand the portfolio of quick-impact and highly visible interventions aimed at stimulating dialogue and support for reconciliation during the upcoming holidays. Previous activities leveraging popularity of football in Libya, such as TRIP020 and BENG057, were successful in bringing together groups on the opposite sides of political conflict and cultivating stronger sense of unity.
The key assumption behind this activity is that if popular and engaging events provide positive opportunities and encourage greater interaction between different communities, then they will help restore public faith and support for a peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflict. This is because the lack of opportunities for interaction between different towns and communities in Libya has been a driver of conflict between them.

In order to counter the trend of increasingly curtailed freedom of expression and the lack of objective and accountable reporting, LTI2 will partner with Lawyers for Justice in Libya (LFJL) in supporting media practitioners to professionalize and improve the standards of media reporting by helping them in development of a code of ethics and increasing public awareness of the importance of a free, pluralistic and ethical media environment. In this activity, LTI2 will fund the workshop in Amman, Jordan for core group of 15 editors, journalists and activists from all parts of Libya to develop a code of ethics for media, and a media campaign to promote the code and encourage broader support and compliance by media professionals and outlets. 
This grant builds on past program efforts such as NAT001, TRIP107, TRIP132 and BENG041, and complements the ongoing TIP014, to support moderate voices in Libyan media by building their capacity to communicate effectively and credibly.

If influential Libyan media professionals have an improved understanding of international best practices and media ethics, they will be able and willing to contribute to the development and promotion of a Libyan media code of ethics; because they lack expertise and a platform through which to engage in such an exercise. 
",Journalists in action: Developing a Libyan media code of ethics,"
Libya’s post-revolution political transition became derailed in 2014. In the east, Operation Dignity was launched in May 2014 to root out extremist groups in Benghazi, escalating into an all-out conflict for the city. In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments formed in alignment with these alliances, increasing polarization and raising fears that Libya could split along regional lines. Each side sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fueling instability across Libya. More recently, conflict fatigue has set it in, prompting popular calls for peace. A fragile, UN-sponsored peace agreement was signed by some parties to the conflict in Morocco in July 2015 while local reconciliation initiatives have proliferated in western Libya. Powerful spoilers remain outside of these agreements, making the immediate future unclear.
In this environment, the freedom of speech, and balanced media coverage of current events in Libya has grown very limited. Moderate voices supporting dialogue and peace face significant challenges on multiple fronts. As the Libya Dawn versus Dignity divide has become more entrenched, media outlets and journalists have felt pressure to align with one side. This polarization has resulted in biased or tendentious reporting that only exacerbated the conflict and fed public distrust of television channels and social media. Some outlets have been turned into propaganda megaphones for those in power. Other media outlets have been used to incite xenophobic hatred and violence against political opponents, minorities and other vulnerable groups. In post-revolution Libya, media often abuse the privacy and integrity of ordinary people through careless reporting and sensationalism thereby causing considerable damage to individuals. Professional balanced journalists are now operating in a significantly reduced space for objective reporting and face increased restrictions on free speech and pressure to openly align with one or the other political side. As momentum has developed in support of peace, there is an opportunity for the media to play a more positive role in support of dialogue and unity. 
In response to the emerging context, LTI2 will continue to support initiatives that aim to develop the capacity of media practitioners and assist their efforts to improve the standards of media reporting. Under TRIP107, LTI supported the Lawyers for Justice Libya (LFJL) in their campaign, Sawti (‘My Voice/Vote’) to raise awareness of the importance of freedom of expression and enable key stakeholders to engage in a way which promotes and protects this fundamental human right. Through Sawti campaign, LFJL carried out a number of activities, including a successful capacity building workshop in November 2014, during which its experts trained media professionals, activists and lawyers on freedom of expression and advocacy in hostile environment. In addition, the training provided media practitioners with safe environment to discuss their freedom of expression concerns. Some of the major issues brought up during the workshop were concerns about the nefarious impact of the fractured political situation on the media institutions in the country and the lack of adequate legal framework to protect free expression or criminalize violations. This, combined with the general lack of understanding of freedom of expression issues and accountable and objective reporting, only exacerbated the already dire state of the media in the country. 
In order to counter the trend of increasingly limited freedom of expression and unaccountable reporting, LTI2 is sponsoring interventions aimed at generating greater awareness of freedom of expression issues and assisting the efforts to create a self-regulating code of ethics, which would help inform media practitioners on their rights and guide them on how to perform their roles responsibly. In this grant, LTI2 will support LFJL in further assisting media practitioners to professionalize and improve the standards of media reporting, create and adopt a code of ethics for media and increase public awareness and understanding of the importance of a free, pluralistic and ethical media environment. 
This particular activity will consist of the following components:
(i)	Code of Ethics workshop – the workshop will take place in Amman, Jordan and will bring together xx editors, journalists and practitioners, including print, broadcasting and photo media, in addition to freedom of expression activists, bloggers and citizen journalists, to develop a code of ethics. The code is envisaged to be reflective of the self-identified needs and aspirations of Libyan media professionals in order to facilitate compliance. The selected group will be geographically diverse and representative of different sides on the political spectrum in Libya. 
(ii)	Libyan Media Platform – LFJL will launch an on-line platform to host the code of ethics and promote its content and attract other media professionals to commit to the provisions. The platform will also include additional resources and supporting materials and a space for discussions and webinars for media practitioners. In order to build a soft mechanism of encouraging enforcement and accountability, the on line media platform will include an on-going update on the CoE adoption and its members’ activities. 
(iii)	Public Service Announcements (PSAs) – During the campaign, the LFJL will launch two PSAs; one prior to the code’s adoption to raise public awareness and underline the urgency for the development of the media code of ethics, and one to support the broader media campaign aimed to encourage other media practitioners to opt into the code. Supportive activities will be publicized on the website to provide information about the geographical distribution of the code’s adoption and allow for complaints to be submitted.
(iv)	Media monitoring – LFJL will monitor Libyan media environment and document legal developments related to media regulation. The findings will be publicized through regular Sawti reports that were originally launched during TRIP107 and will include information on conduct of media professionals and outlets both against the code of ethics and international human rights standards. The reports will be publicized on the Sawti website and are intended to incentivize members to adhere to the agreed standards and encourage other media institutions to consider their conduct with respect to the established values. 
The above workshops will be designed and conducted by LFJL trainers and assisted by international trainer Saloua Ghazouani Oueslati, the Article 19 Tunisia Country Director, who is an expert on media ethics and self-regulation. 
This grant builds on past program efforts such as NAT001, TRIP107, TRIP132 and BENG041, and complements the ongoing TIP014, to support moderate voices in Libyan media by building their capacity to communicate effectively and credibly. The activity assumes that the continued targeted engagement with influential media professionals in Libya will help improve their understanding of international best practice in media ethics and equip them with capacity to develop and publicly lobby for media code of ethics.

Defying the outcome of the June 2014 legislative elections, Dawn politicians re-established the defunct General National Congress (GNC) and formed an unrecognized government in Tripoli. Despite initially delivering improved security and basic services, Dawn militias have struggled to maintain these improvements while expanding the conflict against Zintan and its affiliates. Battle lines had oscillated along the foothills of the Nafusa Mountains as well as the coastal region west of Tripoli, drawing many western towns into a protracted conflict, which only recently started to subside.



Meanwhile, the United Nations-led peace talks in the neighboring Morocco have continued to engage high-level representatives from Libya, but are yet to produce a viable agreement on unity government. At the same time, over the course of the past three months, the Western region witnessed significant reduction in violence, as prominent local elders and militia leaders facilitated series of peace deals among warring factions. These included significant trust-building measures, such as prisoner exchanges, expanded freedom of movement, and local power-sharing arrangements, all of which combined changed the dynamics in the West and created an opportunity for positive action at the local level. Albeit fragile, these peace efforts have countered the strong sense of disillusionment and declining morale among the population fatigued by the months of fighting and restored hopes in regional reconciliation. 



In response to this trend, and as a part of a broader effort to promote greater interaction among groups on the opposite sides of the conflict, LTI2 will support Love it, Build it Organization to hold a large youth gathering to bring together young activists from key strategic towns in the West for the evening of social activities and networking. The event, which will take place in the Wadan Hotel in the Tripoli Center, will be an opportunity for approximately 170 participants from Tripoli Center, Suq Jumma, Tajoura, Zaweya, Janzour, and Wershefanana to meet each other, take part in a round table discussion on the ways to support the ongoing peace efforts, but also engage socially during an entertainment-packed evening, including snack and refreshments, a concert of a popular music band and stand-up comedy. While LTI2 organized a number of youth gatherings in the past, this is the first time than such an event would take a place at a large scale and involve over hundred participants from several restive Tripoli neighborhoods and other coastal towns like Zawiya, Sabratha, Zuwara and Misrata. To support the effort, the grantee and LTI2 worked closely with other program partners, such as Al-Mubader Center from Zawiya, H2O and Huna production, with intention to strengthen these partnerships and tap into a broader and more diverse CSO network. The event will be a good opportunity for LTI2 to make connections with activists and organizations working in program’s strategic areas and explore ways to engage them in future activities intended to support the ongoing reconciliation efforts. Finally, this gathering will build on the successes of previous similar activities that provided space for positive interaction and created a more uplifting narrative to counter the prevailing sense of irrelevance and despondence among Libyan youth. 



Under TIP024, LTI2 will support Love it, Build it in the organization of an all-evening event, including a discussion on ongoing reconciliation efforts and series of social activities. This grant will enable LTI 2 to partner with a new organization and expand the portfolio of quick-impact and highly visible interventions aimed at stimulating dialogue and support for reconciliation during the upcoming holidays. Previous activities that encouraged greater social interaction, such as TIP015 and TIP022, were successful in bringing together groups on the opposite sides of political conflict and cultivating a stronger sense of purpose and unity. The organizers will invite traditional media to cover the event, create a recognizable hashtag and produce a short video for use by social media.



The key assumption behind this activity is that popular and engaging events would encourage greater interaction between different groups and help restore public faith and support for the peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflict.

The grant will support the installation of one playground set in Dreibeeka neighborhood of Tripoli Center and a campaign to promote the work of the municipal council and encourage greater community engagement. The objective of this effort is to strengthen the credibility of local municipal government among the public by assisting it in providing tangible community engagement project and developing interaction opportunities. In addition to boosting government legitimacy, the activity will create space for greater inter-group contact and help strengthen social trust, which has been weakened as a result of the decades of Gadhafi rule and subsequent political conflict. In this program cluster, LTI2 will directly partner with the Tripoli Center municipal council, while IRI is expected to provide complementary capacity building and mentoring throughout the process.

These activities assume that the ability of municipal councils to mobilize local residents and deliver highly visible community-engagement projects would strengthen their legitimacy among citizens and enable them to play more vital role in the governance process at the local level.

In July 2014, militias fought for control of Tripoli, with forces aligned under the banner of Libya Dawn emerging victorious. Parallel legislatures and governments formed in alignment with these alliances, increasing polarization and raising fears that Libya could split along regional lines. Each side sought to recruit proxy groups and secure control of Libya’s lucrative oil industry, inflaming local conflicts and fueling instability across Libya. More recently, conflict fatigue has set it in, prompting popular calls for peace. A fragile, UN-sponsored peace agreement was signed by some parties to the conflict in Morocco in July 2015 while local reconciliation initiatives have proliferated in western Libya. Powerful spoilers remain outside of these agreements, making the immediate future unclear.
Following the bifurcation of Libya’s national legislative and executive branches in 2014, the country’s municipal councils, established a year earlier, remain as its most legitimate democratic authority. According to LTI-sponsored research under TRIP135 in Tripoli, 72 per cent of respondents perceived the councils as having a great deal or fair amount of legitimacy, significantly higher than either of the national legislatures. However, following the slowdown and eventual halt in the disbursal of national revenues as a result of the conflict, the municipal councils currently lack resources to exercise their authority and establish credibility among their constituents. The TRIP134 survey recorded that only 1 per cent of respondents perceived the councils to wield the most authority in Libya’s capital. Bridging the yawning gap between the legitimacy and authority of the municipal councils will help to establish the citizen-state relationship and invigorate waning public support for Libya’s democratic transition.
With intention to support this process, LTI2 is assisting municipal councils in 12 towns across Libya in implementing tangible community engagement projects - the multi-functional playgrounds for children and youth - to encourage greater social interaction in local communities and build public confidence in local government's ability to deliver services. By bringing together local authorities, civil society, and community members to deliver practical projects, these activities aim to build relationships among key stakeholders and bolster the visibility and legitimacy of municipal councils in their areas. As a part of this programming cluster, LTI2 will partner with International Republican Institute (IRI) to identify and support complementary outreach activities to assist municipal councils in pursuing effective public outreach campaigns. The activities would be designed with the goal to support the joint community investment, but also encourage greater public participation and transparency in decision-making.
In this activity, LTI2 will support the installation of a playground set in Tripoli Center Dreibeeka neighborhood and an accompanying outreach campaign. Dreibeeka lays between Zaweyat Dahmany and the restive Fashloom and the existing public park provides a rare space for youth and communities from the two neighborhoods to interact. As a way of engaging the residents and civil society groups and starting to develop relationships with constituents, Municipal Council plans also to hold a town hall meeting and organize a neighborhood clean-up campaign. In collaboration with IRI and Tripoli Center council, LTI 2 will support a media campaign to inform citizens about the new playground and provide basic information about the work of the council.

The grant seeks to improve capacity of Souq al Juma municipal council to accurately map its municipality through the provision of GIS equipment. Souq al Juma is one of Tripoli’s biggest municipalities. With the population of 300,000, it is among the most densely populated areas in the country. During the 1990s, the municipality experienced a period of rapid and unregulated growth, with massive population expansion. The provision of services did not go hand-in-hand with urban development, and education, transportation, utilities and even voting stations, did not reflect population distribution, resulting in an administrative chaos and acute inequities. The GIS will provide the council with the capacity to collect and organize rudimentary information on their municipality, understand the needs of the population and ultimately better serve its community. LTI will further assist the council with a large town hall gathering to explain the long-term benefits of the GIS infrastructure for the municipality and its residents. This initiative, implemented in partnership with International Republican Institute (IRI), will contribute to efforts to increase effective local governance.

If we assist Souq al Juma municipal council with the delivery of GIS infrastructure, then we will increase the capacity of the council to accurately map and understand the needs of its municipality, because:



•	Municipal council would have an interest and resources to maintain the system beyond the life of the grant

•	Municipal council will be able to use the system to make tangible improvements in service delivery to the residents

•	Residents would be receptive and open to understanding the long-term benefits of this system for the whole municipality

According to LTI-sponsored research under TRIP134 in Tripoli, 72 per cent of respondents perceived the councils as having a great deal or fair amount of legitimacy, significantly higher than either of the national legislatures. However, following the slowdown and eventual halt in the disbursal of national revenues as a result of the conflict, the municipal councils currently lack resources to exercise their authority and establish credibility among their constituents. The TRIP134 survey recorded that only 1 per cent of respondents perceived the councils to wield the most authority in Libya’s capital. Bridging the yawning gap between the legitimacy and authority of the municipal councils will help to establish the citizen-state relationship and invigorate waning public support for Libya’s democratic transition.



With intention to support this process, LTI2 is assisting municipal councils in 12 towns across Libya in implementing tangible community engagement and capacity building projects. This initiative aims to bring together local authorities, civil society and community members to deliver practical projects and build relationships among key stakeholders. The ultimate goal of the effort is to increase capacity of the councils, encourage greater citizen participation and build public confidence in local governance. 



As a part of this programming cluster, LTI2 will partner with International Republican Institute (IRI) to provide Souq al Juma municipal council’s Urban Planning Department with the Geographic Information System (GIS) equipment and an outreach campaign. Souq al Juma is one of Tripoli’s biggest municipalities and it is considered as the capital’s gate to the east. With the population of around 300,000, it is among the most densely populated areas in the country. During the 1990s, the municipality experienced a period of rapid and unregulated growth, with massive population expansion that was only exacerbated after the Revolution. The provision of services did not go hand-in-hand with urban development, and education, transportation, utilities and even voting stations, did not reflect population distribution, resulting in an administrative chaos and acute inequities. The GIS will provide the council with the capacity to collect and organize rudimentary information on their municipality and enable it to make more informed decisions that benefit the municipal population as a whole. Given its history and present challenges, the municipal council has been eager to set up a system that would enable it to better understand the demographic distribution on the territory of the municipality and ultimately better serve the community.



To complement this effort,  the International Republic Institute (IRI) will provide continued support to the Souq al Juma municipal council and organize comprehensive capacity building for council’s Urban Planning Department. This will consists of an immediate technical training on the use of the system for 10 staff working in the department and a longer-term support on integrating the GIS capacity into an effective urban planning system. In addition, LTI and IRI will assist the council in organizing a town hall meeting for up to 500 people, including media, to speak about the benefits of GIS and explain how the governments in other countries use this infrastructure to improve decision-making, service delivery and citizen engagement. While LTI will fund the event, IRI will provide an experienced facilitator to support Suq al Juma mayor and other councils in managing the public discussions. This partnership between LTI and IRI will make the joint project more enduring and potentially create an opportunity for expanding this capacity to other councils in Libya. 



This activity will enable the Souq al Juma municipal council to strengthen its capacity to collect and organize municipal data through accurate maps and ultimately better serve the residents. Additionally, it will create an opportunity for consultations with citizens through an opening ceremony and a town hall meeting to present the long-term benefits of the GIS system for the community. This initiative, implemented in partnership with IRI, will contribute to efforts to increase effective local governance.

TIP033,Tripoli MCs Coordination Committee,Closed,2016-04-19,2016-12-31,23011.56,23011.56,"
The activity seeks to increase the ability of five Tripoli MCs to effectively coordinate their response to communities’ needs in Souq al Juma, Abu Salim, Tripoli Center, Tajoura, and Hay al Andalus. In order to achieve this objective, LTI and IRI will support the establishment of the Tripoli Municipal Council Coordination Committee as a mechanism for collaboration among the 5 councils, joint advocacy with the Ministry of Local Governance, and response to shared problems. LTI will provide in kind support to establish the committee's office in Tripoli center, while IRI will provide capacity building, seminars, and meeting facilitation. This activity targets these five MCs because more than 70 percent of Tripoli’s population resides within these five municipalities and 80 percent of the public service institutions are located there. Lack of coordination among these MCs is one of the main challenges facing them when responding to their communities’ needs, and LTI 2 support aims to strengthen the TMCCC as a sustainable coordination platform among these MCs and model for local governance coordination in Libya.


","
If LTI2 supports the TMCCC in-kind support for its formal establishment , then LTI2 will increase the ability of five Tripoli MCs to effectively coordinate in response to joint problems and advocate at the national level for resources, because:

- There are many issues that jointly impact all municipal councils, particularly in Tripoli, and that require a coordinate response, AND

- There is currently no mechanism for addressing these needs collaboratively in Tripoli, AND

- There is strong interest from these five MCs in coordinating their efforts to address mutual problems, AND

- IRI will provide complementary capacity building and facilitation of regular sessions and meets for the committee



 



 
",In It Together: Tripoli MCs Coordination Committee,"
At the beginning of 2016, Libya’s political future is more uncertain than at any time since the 2011 revolution. Political division, armed conflict and a crisis of legitimacy at the national level have accelerated the fragmentation of Libya’s governance landscape. Regional coalitions which formed in 2014 have fractured during 2015 and cities and municipalities have become increasingly isolated. Libya’s two nominal national governments both exert little authority outside their respective bases in Tripoli and Tobruk. The political elites involved in the UN-sponsored dialogue to form a unity government lack legitimacy and the country lacks a national political leadership that can claim a mandate to negotiate a solution to Libya’s crises. The collapse of the national-level political process and institutions has shifted significant governance responsibilities to local formal and informal actors. Municipal councils are viewed as the most credible institutions, though they face serious challenges to providing services to their constituents. The collapse of state institutions and the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security vacuum to strengthen its presence in Libya.
In light of the political conflict and dysfunction plaguing the national level since 2014, the country’s municipal councils, established a year earlier, remain Libya's most legitimate democratic authority. According to LTI 2-sponsored research with Altai, a wide majority of Libyans have a positive perception of the role of the municipal councils. In Tripoli specifically, LTI 2 found in 2015 that 72 per cent of respondents perceived the councils as having a great deal or fair amount of legitimacy, significantly higher than any national institution. However, given problems in the disbursal of national revenues as a result of the conflict in Libya, the municipal councils currently lack resources to exercise their authority, communicate effectively, and establish credibility among their constituents. 
With the goal of increasing confidence in local governance, LTI2 is assisting several key municipal councils across Libya to better provide basic services and communicate with their citizens. Since they were elected, the Municipal Councils have been operating without financial support, which hindered their ability to provide full services to their communities. In addition , lack of coordination when responding to community needs is one of the main challenges facing MCs in Libya. This issue is particularly relevant in Tripoli where all the MCs are next to each other and face shared challenges in security, firefighting, public health, and road maintenance - to name a few examples. To address this challenge in Tripoli, Souq al Juma, Abu Salim, Tripoli Center, Tajoura, and Hay al Andalus MCs established the Tripoli MCs Coordination Committee (TMCC C) in February 2016. The TMCCC brings together the five main municipal councils in Tripoli to coordinate and effectively work together. More than 70 percent of Tripoli’s population resides within these five municipalities and 80 percent of the public service institutions are located there. The goal of this committee is to create space for interaction and communication among these MCs and to help them to coordinate their work and advocate for resources with the Ministry of Local Governance. 
To support the TMCCC, LTI2 will partner with International Republican Institute (IRI) to equip and staff the committee’s office and to provide technical support to facilitate monthly seminars and regular meetings. During this launch phase of the TMCCC, the committee will develop and refine the terms of cooperation between the MCs, build its relationship with national level ministries, discuss shared issues and opportunities for collaboration, solicit public feedback on priorities for the TMCCC, develop joint initiatives for service delivery and/or improvement, and receive dedicated training and support from IRI-contracted facilitators  LTI 2 will provide the TMCCC with office equipment and supplies and surge management support for 6 months. IRI support will cover the cost of the seminars and meetings, including external technical assistance. This support will help the TMCCC to effectively coordinate and address communities’ needs in five Tripoli municipalities.

The activity seeks to increase cooperation between MTC and Tripoli Center community when identifying and addressing community needs. This activity is targeting MTC and Tripoli Center community including volunteers and community leaders. Lack of interaction with its community is one of the main challenges facing MTC. MTC has been looking for creative ways to invite community members to proactively engage in its work, as a way to both serve the community together, but also to start to open the channels for discussion about the roles and responsibilities of the MTC. LTI2 and MTC have identified promoting volunteerism as an effective way to connect and to engage with the community. LTI2 will support MTC to establish a volunteer office and to conduct a facilitated public dialogue session. This support will include office equipment, furniture and supplies, in addition to a catalyst fund to support the initial coordinated activity selected by the MTC and the volunteer office. Also, LTI2 will provide media and outreach materials for the public event. The provision of this support will increase participatory and inclusive local governance.
","
If we support MTC in establishing a volunteer office and conducting a public event to discuss the community's priorities and needs, then we will increase engagement and coordination between MTC and citizens in addressing community needs. Because: 

•Tripoli Center community wants to engage with their MC to address community needs.

•There will be an enhanced understanding and agreement of why some activities are prioritized over others. People at the event will understand how the activities are prioritized, what limited funds are available to address community needs, and why volunteers when directed to the priorities of the community can make a significant impact in coordinating with the MTC. 

•MTC wants to connect with and to include their community when planning and providing services. If the MTC has a platform to demonstrate that they want to engage their community, this will help build this link, and foment trust between the MTC and the community. 

•MTC has the capacity to absorb volunteers when implementing projects. Also, Tripoli citizens want to volunteer.






",Building the Connection Between MTC and the Community through Volunteerism,"

In light of the political conflict and dysfunction plaguing the national level since 2014, the country’s municipal councils, established a year earlier, remain Libya's most legitimate and functional democratic authority. According to recent LTI 2-sponsored research with Altai, a wide majority of Libyans have a positive perception of the role of the municipal councils. In Tripoli specifically, LTI 2 found in 2015 that 72 per cent of respondents perceived the councils as having a great deal or fair amount of legitimacy, significantly higher than any national institution. However, since these institutions are such a new concept in Libya, most Libyans lack a basic understand of the roles and responsibilities of the municipal councils and how constituents should engage with them. Moreover, given problems in the disbursal of national revenues as a result of the conflict in Libya, the municipal councils currently lack resources to exercise their authority, communicate effectively, and establish credibility among their constituents, leading to a decreasing trust of MCs, after an initial wave of hope that the country finally had some form of a legitimate governance institution, representative and responsive to the people. Thus, with the goal of increasing confidence in local governance, LTI 2 is assisting several key municipal councils across Libya to better provide basic services and engage with residents, the two main drivers of trust based on our research findings. 
The Municipality of Tripoli Central (MTC) was elected in May 2014, and it consists of 10 members (one female) and 40 council staff (12 female). MTC has several offices such as the education, culture and health offices. MTC has implemented many projects to provide services to the local community. For example, in December, 2015, LTI2 partnered with MTC to install two playground sets in Soor Road (TIP026) and Shohada Al Manshia (TIP025). These projects have helped MTC to start building its relationship with its community. Still, challenges exist, both lack of productive interaction with the communities and lack of resources. To help address these challenges, LTI2 will support the (MTC) to establish a volunteer office to promote volunteerism in its municipality - volunteerism that helps to address and support some governance functions and promotes an enhanced understanding between the MTC and the community.
In this activity, LTI2 will provide MTC with in-kind support to establish a volunteer office and to conduct a public event with facilitated dialogue sessions and a session to honor pioneer volunteers. This public event will be an opportunity for MTC to work with residents and CSOs to prioritize community needs and to establish a mechanism to coordinate volunteers's work. The Tripoli Center community will be represented in the public event by 10-15 Mukhtar Mahalla (District Councils) and around 150 active members in civil society actors. LTI2 support will include equipment, furniture and office supplies, media and outreach materials for the public event sessions and some technical support. LTI2’s support will help MTC to increase coordination and engagement with its community, on priority issues of great importance and relevance to both the MTC and the community. 
In addition to LTI2 support, International Republican Institute (IRI) will provide capacity building trainings for a number the volunteer office’s staff. IRI will determine these training needs through an assessment for the office staff.

This activity aims to increase understanding among Tripoli active youth about the need for a unity government and the LPA. To achieve this objective, LTI will provide assistance to support Libyan Youth Association to facilitate dialogue sessions among CSO’s, university students, and student unions about the GNA and LPA. The sessions will take place in Tripoli, and the event day will be held inside Tripoli University if the situation is stable and secure. The situation in Tripoli is very critical and since GNA will be operating from Tripoli, it is very important to reengage youth in Tripoli ; as they represent the majority of the population, and get their support to the new government. LYA is a very active organization based in Tripoli. The organization had partnered with ACTED in implementing Ambassadors for Change project, and Volunteered as observers during the GNC elections back in July 2012. Also, they are the organizers for the International day for volunteering event yearly, and they were part of many other community service projects.
","
If LTI supports Libyan Youth Association to conduct dialogue sessions that highlight the urgency of having a unity government and provides information about the LPA, then we will increase active youth understanding of the GNA and the LPA.

· This assumes that students have been disillusioned by and lost interest in the political process recently and/or misled by media and other extreme            voices.

·  It assumes that holding the dialogue session through trusted conveners – CSOs and student unions – will encourage youth participation in the event and strengthen the legitimacy of information shared.


· It also assumes that highlighting some the consequences of conflict using some Lets Agree Now materials and providing information about how the         LPA is designed to address those problems will increase support for the unity government and understanding of the LPA’s contents.
",Connecting Youth to the GNA: Dialogue Sessions at Tripoli University,"
At the beginning of 2016, Libya’s political future is more uncertain than at any time since the 2011 revolution. Political division, armed conflict and a crisis of legitimacy at the national level have accelerated the fragmentation of Libya’s governance landscape. Regional coalitions which formed in 2014 have fractured during 2015 and cities and municipalities have become increasingly isolated. Libya’s two nominal national governments both exert little authority outside their respective bases in Tripoli and Tobruk. The political elites involved in the UN-sponsored dialogue to form a unity government lack legitimacy and the country lacks a national political leadership that can claim a mandate to negotiate a solution to Libya’s crises. The collapse of the national-level political process and institutions has shifted significant governance responsibilities to local formal and informal actors. Municipal councils are viewed as the most credible institutions, though they face serious challenges to providing services to their constituents. The collapse of state institutions and the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security vacuum to strengthen its presence in Libya.

After over a year of dialogue, representatives from various political factions signed the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) in Morocco in late 2015. The new Government of National Accord is (GNA) is currently working to rally support for the agreement and establish its authority and legitimacy in country. A critical mass of support is beginning to grow, particularly from the general public and many municipal councils, but powerful spoilers on both sides remain opposed to the agreement. Furthermore, successive rounds of polling in Libya throughout 2015 have revealed an increasingly strong disdain for national political institutions and actors, and Libyans are disillusioned with the failure of previous transitional efforts at the national level. Given the present fragility of the new GNA and the need to rally public support in favor of the political agreement, LTI 2 is partnering with influential Libyan CSOs and media outlets to increase active public support for the GNA. In addition, LTI 2 is educating the public about the political agreement and the GNA's immediate priorities.

Especially in Tripoli, students and youth played a key role in the revolution and subsequent political transition after 2011, and they also led the emergence of the civil society sector in Libya. However, with the political conflict and dysfunction at the national level over the past 2 years, youth have grown disillusioned with politics and civic activism. They also lack understanding about the GNA and LPA, and are not fully aware of the need for a strong unity government to provide solutions for Libya. Because the situation in Tripoli is so sensitive, youth and students are hesitant to get involved in any political matters. However, their engagement in the political process over the next 1-2 years is critical. Student unions and youth civil society groups in particular are influential, as they are comprised of educated, active youth. It’s very important to engage them in the political process and educate them, as they have the ability to be a catalyst to influence a wider cross-section of the youth population.



Thus, LTI 2 is supporting Libyan Youth Association to conduct dialogue sessions about the GNA & LPA and solutions for addressing urgent economic, social, and political problems that have emerged because of the conflict. 30 main participants representing university students, CSOs, and Student Unions will divide into groups and work with a couple of trainers and facilitators to prepare for panel sessions and question/answer sessions on different topics related to the GNA and political agreement. Then, the grantee will conduct dialogue sessions, focused on solutions provided through the LPA and GNA. The grantee will also be documenting the sessions to share the ongoing discussions on social media, as well as engaging the social media followers in the discussions. A video will be produced presenting the key highlights.

This grant to the Tripoli Center Municipal Council seeks to increase confidence in the MC’s ability to address the concerns of youth and all groups in the municipality. In order to accomplish this objective, LTI 2 will support the Tripoli Center MC by supporting the establishment of youth committee, procuring and installing a football court in Tripoli Center and supporting an initial community engagement event involving the MC, area youth, and the community. The Tripoli Center MC has long been struggling to reach youth and get them to engage positively in their community and the local council. This activity will provide a tangible indication of the MC's commitment to addressing young people and develop a community space for regular engagement between community youth and the MC. At the same time, the MC, district-level mukhtar al-mahalla, and community leaders are establishing a youth committee to oversee the space and activities and ensure ongoing opportunities for interaction between the MC and area youth.


","
If we support the MC to provide this football field through the youth committee, we will increase youth confidence in the MC’s ability to address their needs and strengthen their sense that local authorities are paying attention to them. The assumptions are:

- Youth want to engage with their MCs but do not have any channels or methods for doing so.

- If MC provides something tangible and highly visible to demonstrate that they care about youth, it will help build this link. 

- The activity also assumes that the football fields are the most effective way to engage youth based on past M&E, researches and the demands of youth and CSOs which been made to the municipal Councils. 

- The football court and youth committee will be the mechanism for regular interaction between members of the MC and youth in the community.

Still, challenges exist, particularly with regard to youth engagement with the municipal council and local governance. Youth are one of the most important, yet most neglected segments of the population in Libya. They feel like their voice is not heard within the MC, and they are disillusioned with political processes and leaders more broadly. They feel excluded from having a role in their communities and thus are more drawn toward militias and gangs in the area. Youth - in addition to the wider community - has been demanding that the MC do something to reach out and provide avenues for more positive youth engagement in the community. 

In this activity, LTI 2 will partner with the Tripoli Center MC to support the establishment of the youth committee, installation of football court to facilitate youth-MC interaction, and an outreach campaign with initial community engagement activity. LTI 2 M&E data and research with Altai has consistently shown that football is by far the most effective way to engage the youth population in Libya. Not only is it a significant sign of the MC's tangible commitment to serving youth, but the space itself will also be a forum for regular engagement between community youth and the MC - serving the same function as regular town hall meetings. At the same time, the MC must establish a formal mechanism to help bridge the gap youth and the MC, manage this football court, and organize regular activities. LTI is working closely with the municipal council office of youth and sport, district-level mukhtar al-mahalla, and community leaders on the establishment of this committee.

Tajoura is a home to approximately 230,000 people and includes urban areas closer to Tripoli and semi-urban areas of housing and farmland encompassing the major road to Misrata. Because of its strategic location, Tajoura has been considered as a ‘gate to Tripoli’ and its population has been somewhat split in their allegiances between various war lords. This is one of the most restive municipalities in Tripoli which sees frequent public disturbances and even minor clashes. The Tajoura Municipal Council consists of 10 municipal council members (1 female). Tajoura has had a strong municipal council since 2014, which gained confidence among residents early on through its efforts on community improvement projects. LTI has collaborated with the council on several projects implemented with Tajoura CSOs, including TRIP109 (Equipping the Center for Hearing Impaired Children) TRIP110 (Supporting Access to Information & Culture). Also, LTI 2 worked directly with the council on the installation of the playground in Tajoura under TIP030. Still, like many other municipal councils in Libya, the Tajoura MC has struggled to maintain residents' confidence as funding constraints have restricted its ability to provide basic services. 
In this activity, LTI 2 will provide Tajoura MC with in-kind support to address a highly visible public problem - traffic lights that are not functioning at critical intersections in the municipality. Tajoura is the eastern gate for Tripoli, people inside and outside Tajoura use the road to Tajoura to travel to the east, but most of the traffic lights are damaged. LTI will help the MC to replace traffic lights in two key locations in Tajoura - at the Eastern gate to Tripoli and the hospital intersection. Also, LTI 2 will support the MC to conduct an opening ceremony, an awareness campaign, and finally a town hall meeting about the project. The initiative will be led by the MC but in close cooperation with the Traffic Police (Ministry of Interior), Ministry of Education, Ministry of Local Governance, local businesses, and local CSOs such as the Scouts. This activity will be an opportunity for Tajoura MC to provide some basic services related to the resident’s safety which will strengthen residents’ confidence in the MC. The awareness campaign will consists of billboards, a radio and Facebook campaign, and printed materials with information about the upgrades at these two key intersections. Finally, a town hall meeting will be an opportunity to inform public about the mutual collaboration between the national level government and the MC.

They are the most populated and producing the highest level of waste within Tripoli center. Responding to the needs of the residents in providing these vital services is one of the main challenges facing the MC. LTI2’s support in this highly visible public problem will contribute to increase effective local governance.

If we support the MC to provide rubbish bins in coordination with and outreach activity to its community, it will improve the performance of the municipal council in waste management in these areas and strengthen the ability to deliver basic services.•	The activity assumes that the municipal council is able to continue in effectively delivering collection services to its residents through the regular trash collection services and the primary obstacle is the lack of large rubbish bins and lack of understanding among residents about the proper procedures for collection. •	It assumes that the MC will be able to reach out to residents and community leaders in these 2 areas about the new procedures, and each Makhtar al-Mahalla will be able to effectively play a role in public awareness about the new bins and the new procedures. 
",Tripoli Center Waste Management,"
At the beginning of 2016, Libya’s political future is more uncertain than at any time since the 2011 revolution. Political division, armed conflict and a crisis of legitimacy at the national level have accelerated the fragmentation of Libya’s governance landscape. Regional coalitions which formed in 2014 have fractured during 2015 and cities and municipalities have become increasingly isolated. Libya’s two nominal national governments both exert little authority outside their respective bases in Tripoli and Tobruk. The political elites involved in the UN-sponsored dialogue to form a unity government lack legitimacy and the country lacks a national political leadership that can claim a mandate to negotiate a solution to Libya’s crises. The collapse of the national-level political process and institutions has shifted significant governance responsibilities to local formal and informal actors. Municipal councils are viewed as the most credible institutions, though they face serious challenges to providing services to their constituents. The collapse of state institutions and the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security vacuum to strengthen its presence in Libya.
In light of the political conflict and dysfunction plaguing the national level since 2014, the country’s municipal councils, established a year earlier, remain Libya's most legitimate and functional democratic authority. According to recent LTI 2-sponsored research with Altai, a wide majority of Libyans have a positive perception of the role of the municipal councils. In Tripoli specifically, LTI 2 found in 2015 that 72 per cent of respondents perceived the councils as having a great deal or fair amount of legitimacy, significantly higher than any national institution. However, since these institutions are such a new concept in Libya, most Libyans lack a basic understand of the roles and responsibilities of the municipal councils and how constituents should engage with them. Moreover, given problems in the disbursal of national revenues as a result of the conflict in Libya, the municipal councils currently lack resources to exercise their authority, communicate effectively, and establish credibility among their constituents, leading to a decreasing trust of MCs, after an initial wave of hope that the country finally had some form of a legitimate governance institution, representative and responsive to the people. Thus, with the goal of increasing confidence in local governance, LTI 2 is assisting several key municipal councils across Libya to better provide basic services and engage with residents, the two main drivers of trust based on our research findings. 
The Municipality of Tripoli Central (MTC) was elected in May 2014, and it consists of 10 members (one female) and 40 council staff (12 female). MTC has been very active in projects to start building its relationship with its community and assume responsibilities that are shifting from the national level to MCs. As new service delivery tasks have been handed to the councils from the national level, the municipal councils are trying to meet these new commitments. Part of these new responsibilities include managing public cleaning services and trash collection. During this transitional phase as MCs struggle to gain the capacity to provide these services, trash collection has not been fully functional. It is the most visible consequence of the lack of resources and capacity within the Tripoli center MC. Citizens have been complaining about the waste problem, and Tripoli MC is asking for support. Thus, LTI2 is assisting Tripoli center municipal council in improving the quality and efficiency of its waste management. A big part of the problem is the lack of large rubbish bins (dumpsters) outside of the main buildings in Tripoli Center. As a result, a lot of residents and businesses simply pile trash on the street or sidewalk where the bins should be, making it much more difficult for waste management services to collect the trash. LTI2 will provide rubbish bins outside of all main residential buildings in two of Tripoli center MC districts which are Zawit Aldahmani and Fashlum areas. They are the most populated and producing the highest level of waste within Tripoli center. LTI w will also support and outreach activity and awareness campaign promoting the collection times and procedures, as well as the municipal council's role in improving waste management services. The Makhtar al-Mahala in each area will be involved in distribution of the rubbish bins and the outreach activity, as these community leaders play a significant role in helping the MC identify and respond to public needs. Finally, national level involvement in this activity will be significant, as the local ministry of governance has encouraged LTI 2 to support Tripoli municipal council in adjusting to these new duties, and they are aiming to use the process and lessons learned in Tripoli Center as a model for devolving trash collection services in other municipalities. This activity will build the public’s confidence in the MC by providing a tangible and highly visible service that will involve strong community engagement facilitated by the Makhtar al-Mahalla and MC in each area.

This activity aims at Strengthening Suq al-Jumma residents’ confidence in the government's ability to deliver basic services. In order to do this LTI 2 will support Suq al-Jumma MC to rehabilitate a highly visible public space in the municipality, in coordination with the Ministry of Local Governance, the General Services Company, and the national-level electricity authority. The Public Space is located in the Coastal Road in Suq al-Jumma Municipality. This support will enable the Suq al-Jumma MC to clean up the area, install several benches and covered spaces, and conduct maintenance for the park irrigation system and electricity system in coordination with the Ministry of Local governance and the General Electricity Company of Libya. In addition this activity aims to increase interaction with residents through an opening ceremony and a media campaign. The provision of this support will support effective service delivery to the residents of Suq al-Jumma in coordination with national ministries. 
","
If we provide support the Suq Juma MC to implement the project and refurbish the public space, then this will increase confidence in the MC's ability to delivery basic services in coordination with national ministries. 
Assumptions:
1-	MC and ministries want to deliver services for the community.
2-	The project is a highly visible public space that is a concern for all Suq al-Jumaa residents and the broader Tripoli region.
3-	The awareness campaign will inform the community of the MC’s efforts.
4-	MC wants to properly coordinate with the national level government, GNA, and ministries to implement this project.
        5-We assume that effective service delivery is a key factor in positive public perceptions of municipal councils and their ministry partners.

Moreover, given problems in the disbursal of national revenues, the municipal councils lack resources to exercise their authority, communicate effectively, and establish credibility among their constituents, leading to a decreasing trust of MCs. Also, linkages are weak between the MCs, as Libya's primary service-delivery bodies, and the national level ministries charged with overseeing and funding the MCs. Thus, with the goal of increasing confidence in local governance, LTI 2 is assisting several key municipal councils across Libya to better provide basic services, build bottom-up linkages with national ministries, and engage with residents.
The Suq al-Jumma municipal council (MC) was elected in May 2014, and it consists of 8 members (one female) and 60 council staff (15 female), in absence of government the Suq al-Jumma MC has worked hard to provide basic services such as new traffic lights in close collaboration with companies within the municipality. They have also formed crisis committees such to aide displaced people. The MC was also part in the UN-sponsored dialogue and contributed to facilitate discussion with local community leaders in Tripoli and they initially helped facilitate the entry of and host the Serraj Government in Tripoli 3 months ago. Still, the MC is dealing with 2 main problems. First, is the lack of funding for MC, which has prevented delivering the basic services for public. This has resulted in a lack of opportunities for basic citizen-MC interaction and low confidence in the MC’s ability to deliver. Second, given the chaos at the national level during the past 2 years, ties between the MC and relevant national level authorities are weak or non-existent.
In this project LTI 2 will help Suq al-Jumma MC to rehabilitate a prominent area of the coastal road public park between Shat Cemetery and Mitiga airport. While it is within the MC's jurisdiction, the space's location downtown on the coast makes it high-profile and used by all Tripolitanians and Libyans. LTI will provide the MC with street and park furniture (benches, covered seating and garbage bins) and promotional materials to conduct an opening ceremony and an awareness campaign about the importance of keeping the city clean. In addition to that the MC, in coordination with the Ministry of Local Governance, General Services Company, and General Electricity Company of Libya, will provide a significant investment in the maintenance of the park. They will clean up the park location and conduct maintenance to the irrigation system and the lighting poles. The MC will facilitate all the coordination with these national-level entities. Finally, the opening ceremony and media campaign will provide a well-publicized opportunity to promote the ""Our Shared Responsibility"" effort and reinforce the importance of national-local linkages.

The Islamic State has grown considerably in Libya during the last six months. One such group in Sirte joined IS last fall and has promoted itself as the “Tripoli Province” of the Islamic State. The group embodies the city’s Islamist and jihadist trend that has been active since shortly after the revolution. Throughout 2012 there were frequent shows of force by Islamist armed groups in Sirte featuring parades of technical flying black flags. Most Recent the Islamic states made efforts to institute more strict observance of shariah in the city, confiscating equipment and material from houses such as satellite TV or any printed material that could be deemed ‘haram’ (illegal). There are dire shortages of food, money and medicine, Sirte is a humanitarian catastrophe pushing the town’s residents to flee. However, to leave the city you must abandon all belongings behind. Around 25,000 displaced families arrived to Ben Jawad in the east, Misrata, Tarhouna, Khoms, Bani Walid and most recently in Tripoli. Around 1500 families arrived to Tajoura and Abou Salim and Tripoli Center, there is a tremendous pressure on the MCs to aid these families. 
In  April, 2016 LTI has supported the formation of a coordination committee in Tripoli MC (TMCCC) under TIP033 between five keys MCs in Tripoli, the aim of this support is to increase the ability of Tripoli MCs to effectively coordinate their response to communities’ needs in Souq al Juma, Abu Salim, Tripoli Center, Tajoura, and Hay al Andalus. Upon arrival of more than 1000 displaced families in Tajoura, the TMCCC explored ways to support Tajoura MC given the previous experiences of some of the committee members in responding to crisis included displaced people. LTI has encouraged the cooperation and supported several meeting with the TMCCC and provided some technical advice. Furthermore the TMCCC invited Sirte Crisis Committee which was formed under the Ministry of Social Affairs in 2014 as a way to mitigate the damage on the displaced families.The committee employees developed a database to collect all family names and the national number voluntarily using their personal IT equipment. This has allowed for an organized and fair distribution of aids in many areas with many governmental entities and International Humanitarian organizations.
In this activity, LTI2 will provide TIP033 TMCCC with in-kind support includes essential food supplies for Sirte displaced families in Tajoura and Abu Salim, LTI will also provide Sirte Crisis Committee with an IT equipment to guarantee more efficient and sustainable work. distribution of the Food Supplies will be in coordination with Sirte Crisis Committee and  the Libyan Red Crescent (LRC) to guarantee fair and organized distribution. LTI will also provide Sirte Crisis Committee with an IT equipment to enhance their work quality and guarantee sustainability. The provision of this support will Increase effective local governance in coordination with the national level government.

",Sabrata Field Program Assistant,"
The faltering of Libya’s post-revolution political transition and the spread of violent conflict in 2014 created space for extremist groups already present in Libya to expand their influence and control. Networks of salafi-jihadi groups emerged in many of Libya’s coastal cities after the revolution. In the east, where these groups were strongest, jihadi groups with links to international organizations vied for control of cities such as Derna and Benghazi. In central Libya, the Islamic State (IS) took advantage of local conflicts in Sirte to seize control of the city. In western Libya, salafi-jihadi networks have remained embedded in complex and overlapping networks of political Islamists, apolitical Salafists, revolutionary brigades and political groupings. While the Islamic State remains deeply unpopular in Libya, a variety of extremist groups, some with links to IS and international organizations, remain embedded in local communities and conflicts. Understanding the local contexts and drivers of groups toward extremism is essential to designing effecting programming aimed at countering violent extremism (CVE).

LTI 2 conducted a rigorous assessment of the drivers of violent extremism in western Libya. This assessment showed that many of our assumptions regarding the social, political and economic factors driving extremism are incorrect. Contrary to conventional wisdom, those expressing support for militias and extremist groups reported significantly higher levels of social and political engagement, lower levels of disillusion with the revolution, were less sensitive to corruption and did not report feeling discriminated against. These findings suggest that macro-level interventions based on providing employment opportunities or fostering more community or political engagement are unlikely to support progress toward CVE objectives. Successful CVE interventions should be focused on the community and family level. They should reduce the conducive environment for violent extremism by addressing local conflicts. Also, interventions must disrupt networks that support violent extremism by giving families and communities the tools to identify and support those at risk of radicalization and provide alternatives to extremism.

The purpose of this field program assistant (FPA) is to support LTI 2's objective to develop and implement effective and locally-targeted CVE programming in Sabrata. The FPA will play and important role in ground-truthing LTI 2 activities in and around Sabrata, and he will build networks with individuals and groups in Sabrata willing to address extremism in the area. In addition, he will provide critical support with program implementation and monitoring, as LTI 2 staff are not currently able to travel to Sabrata. LTI 2 will identify and recruit an individual locally in Sabrata with strong connections to local organizations and institutions in the area. The FPA will complete an initial 4-month assignment. This STTA activity also will support occasional short trips to Tripoli and Tunis for planning meetings with LTI 2 staff members.

Municipal councils are viewed as the most credible institutions, though they face serious challenges to providing services to their constituents. The collapse of state institutions and the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security vacuum to strengthen its presence in Libya.

After over a year of dialogue, representatives from various political factions signed the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) in Morocco in late 2015. The new Government of National Accord is (GNA) is currently working to rally support for the agreement and establish its authority and legitimacy in country. A critical mass of support is beginning to grow, particularly from the general public and many municipal councils, but the new government's legitimacy is fragile and powerful spoilers remain opposed to the agreement. Furthermore, successive rounds of polling in Libya throughout 2015 have revealed an increasingly strong disdain for national political institutions and actors, and Libyans are disillusioned with the failure of previous transitional efforts at the national level. Given the present fragility of the new GNA and the need to rally public support in favor of the political agreement, LTI 2 is partnering with trusted local actors such as municipal councils and civil society to increase active public support for the GNA. In addition, LTI 2 is educating the public about the political agreement and the GNA's immediate priorities.



Two municipal councils in Tripoli - Tripoli Center and Abu Saleem - have declared public support for the GNA and political agreement, and LTI is working with these MCs to connect Tripoli residents to the national level political process. Abu Salim is a low-income neighborhood previously strongly associated with Gaddhafi supporters, but currently, it is a home to many powerful local militias and one of the high-crime areas in Tripoli. It is a large area of Tripoli, with over 400,000 residents. Tripoli Center Municipal Council is one of the most powerful MCs in Libya, with oversight of downtown Tripoli. It plays an important informal leadership role among Tripoli-region MCs. 

Through its strategic communications campaign to support the GNA, LTI 2 CSO partners have produced and distributed radio and TV PSAs, printed materials, and other media throughout Libya to educate the public about and buttress the legitimacy of the new GNA and its immediate priorities. This activity is designed with a grassroots approach to reach Tripoli residents and educate them about the GNA using these previously produced materials. LTI will partner with Tripoli Center, Abusaleem municipalities, and the Youth and Sport Authority under the GNA to screen Euro Cup and Copa America Cup football matches in 6 different public locations throughout the month of June and early July. During breaks and before/after matches, the event organizers will display PSAs and distribute printed materials. The timing of this activity and the football matches during Ramadan in the evenings after the breaking of the fast is particularly important, as it is a special time for community gatherings and socializing in Libya. The overall aim is to increase awareness and support for the GNA at the grassroots level in these communities. In addition, MC and ministry-level cooperation on this event will increase the sense that government is starting to function properly and ultimately. strengthen support for the GNA

Also, interventions must disrupt networks that support violent extremism by giving families and communities the tools to identify and support those at risk of radicalization and provide alternatives to extremism.The persistence of violent extremism in Sabratha has less to do with socioeconomic or political drivers than with durable networks and family relationships. Several families have featured prominently in support for extremism in Sabratha, some across generations. Finding a way to break this cycle of radicalization will require empowering families and communities with tools to confront extremism.  The municipal council in Sabratha have become in recent months a more active force against extremist ideologies and presence in Sabratha. Since the US airstrike on Friday morning, February 19, 2016, the Municipal Council has fostered dialogue between different tribes and groups in an effort to create a united front against extremist, and prevent the re-establishment of any safe havens. More recently, the Municipal Council has supported LTI events in Sabratha which have aimed to build bridges both between different local communities, and also between these communities and the MC in Sabratha. In addition, local CSOs are also stepping up their efforts to respond to local conflict dynamics, and have been emboldened to begin to address issues of extremism after recent efforts to unite the community against extremist groups. The light of knowledge of Science and Culture is one such organization, and has approached LTI with this project to support local children and families who have been directly affected by these issues in Sabratha.This activity will respond to these dynamics through the establishment of a summer school and family outreach center, which would provide psychosocial support for children directly affected by conflict. The center would further identify, engage with, and provide support for a small number of selected families that have been impacted by violence and extremism, utilizing local psychologists and social workers. This center would serve as a platform for future work with families in Sabratha to empower them with tools to respond to and reject violent extremism.

following activities: public events at the Sabratha Roman ruins, traditional horse riding exposition, poetry event and in the production of short video focusing on conflict resolution. By working with Sabratha Municipal Council and local CSOs, the activity will also help LTI to build relationships with individuals who are directly affected by extremism and build resilience that reject extremism.

IF the Municipal Council in Sabratha is supported to organize a three-day festival of peace, including a re-affirmation of local peace agreements, THEN local peace and reconciliation efforts will be strengthened, the threat of conflict will be less acute, and communities and local governments will be empowered to reject extremist groups BECAUSE:•	In the absence of conflict, extremist groups lose a key justification for their continued presence in Sabratha.•	Families and communities are better able to resist VE in conditions of peace in their communities.•	Extremist groups are less able to operate in communities which are not in conflict with one another.•	Communities and CSOs will use peace agreements to strengthen local bonds and work to deepen peace and reconciliation initiatives between Sabratha and other areas.
",Sabratha Festival for peace,"
The faltering of Libya’s post-revolution political transition and the spread of violent conflict in 2014 created space for extremist groups already present in Libya to expand their influence and control. Networks of salafi-jihadi groups emerged in many of Libya’s coastal cities after the revolution. In the east, where these groups were strongest, jihadi groups with links to international organizations vied for control of cities such as Derna and Benghazi. In central Libya, the Islamic State (IS) took advantage of local conflicts in Sirte to seize control of the city. In western Libya, salafi-jihadi networks have remained embedded in complex and overlapping networks of political Islamists, apolitical Salafists, revolutionary brigades and political groupings. While the Islamic State remains deeply unpopular in Libya, a variety of extremist groups, some with links to IS and international organizations, remain embedded in local communities and conflicts. Understanding the local contexts and drivers of groups toward extremism is essential to designing effecting programming aimed at countering violent extremism (CVE).LTI 2 conducted a rigorous assessment of the drivers of violent extremism in western Libya. This assessment showed that many of our assumptions regarding the social, political and economic factors driving extremism are incorrect. Contrary to conventional wisdom, those expressing support for militias and extremist groups reported significantly higher levels of social and political engagement, lower levels of disillusion with the revolution, were less sensitive to corruption and did not report feeling discriminated against. These findings suggest that macro-level interventions based on providing employment opportunities or fostering more community or political engagement are unlikely to support progress toward CVE objectives. Successful CVE interventions should be focused on the community and family level and should seek to reduce the conducive environment for violent extremism by addressing local conflicts. Interventions must disrupt networks that support violent extremism by giving families and communities the tools to identify and support those at risk of radicalization and provide alternatives to extremism.The municipal council in Sabratha have become in recent months a more active force against extremist ideologies and presence in Sabratha. Since the US airstrike on 19 February 2016, the Municipal Council has fostered dialogue between different tribes and groups in an effort to create a united front against extremism, and prevent the re-establishment of any safe havens in the city. More recently, the Municipal Council has supported LTI events in Sabratha which have aimed to build bridges both between different local communities, and also between other municipalities in the region and the MC in Sabratha, in order to promote social engagement between Sabratha and its neighbors. These efforts will have tangible impacts on countering violent extremism as it will reduce the probability of a return to violent conflict and remove grievances that could be exploited by extremist groups.This activity will respond to these dynamics through supporting a set of events over a three day period dedicated to reaffirming the local commitments to peace among various groups, culminating in Municipal Council visit including MCs of Zintan, Alrujban and Ajaylat. In addition to these political events, the festival will include broader social outreach including activities such as traditional horse riding, poetry event and producing short video focusing on conflict resolution and reconciliation,  and a CSO forum on developing additional reconciliation activities in Sabratha.The event will culminate in ten municipal councils from both sides of the conflict in western Libya, including Zintan, Alrujban and Ajaylat, visiting Sabratha a recommitting their communities to peace and reconciliation. By working with the Municipal Council of Sabratha, as well as other local MCs, CSOs, and other communities and organizations, this activity will help LTI to build relationships with organizations and individuals in Sabratha who are directly affected by extremism, and support them to develop responses at both the family and organizational level, also building resilience against VE in thesecommunities by supporting ongoing peace efforts.

This activity will support ongoing efforts to build local responses to extremism in Sabratha by providing social workers, teachers and psychologists from LTI's local partner in Sabratha with a structured training on small group interventions for families affected by extremism and on “play therapy” to work with children most affected by conflict. LTI will additionally seek to provide up to 1-2 days for site visits to current CVE/family based programming in Tunisia. During this training, the OKLES staff will work with experienced international trainers to develop a methodology for family outreach in Sabratha, and establish a follow up grant which will seek to implement this methodology directly. By working with this group of trainers and Libyan social workers, LTI will continue to refine and expand its programs in Sabratha, and would support the staff of OKLES to identify, engage with, and support for a small number of selected families. This training will help equip local social workers,psychologists and teachers with the tools for their ongoing work with families in Sabratha, to help empower them with tools to reject and respond to violent extremism.

IF OKLES staff are trained to engage and support local families who have been impacted by violence and extremism in Sabratha THEN these staff will be able to develop local responses to extremism BECAUSE- We assume that people in Sabratha are looking for opportunities and support to reject extremism at the family and community level.- By learning about tools and best practices for early intervention, counselors will better be able to support families to develop responses to extremism in Sabratha.- Family-based responses to extremism are more likely to be successful in Sabratha based on our drivers of extremism assessment.

Also, interventions must disrupt networks that support violent extremism by giving families and communities the tools to identify and support those at riskof radicalization and provide alternatives to extremism.The persistence of violent extremism in Sabratha has less to do with socioeconomic or political drivers than with durable networks and family relationships. Several families have featured prominently in support for extremism in Sabratha, some across generations. Finding a way to breakthis cycle of radicalization will require empowering families and communities with tools to confront extremism.LTI is working with a local partner - Organisation of Knowledge Light for Education and Science –Libya (OKLES) - in Sabratha to provide support to families affected by conflict and extremism through supporting a summer school and family outreach center. The school is providing psychosocialsupport to children, and will soon commence reaching out to local families who are directly affected by these issues, in order to assess their needs and establish potential ways to support them. LTI has supported this team of teachers, psychologists and social workers with a two-day refresher training on psychosocial support for children and conducting family outreach. The next step is to tailor and deepen this knowledge with a structured three-day training on small group interventions for families affected by extremism, and a two day of training on “play therapy” to work with children most affected by conflict. LTI will additionally seek to provide up to a day for site visits to current CVE/family based programming in Tunisia. During this training, the OKLES staff will work with experienced international trainers to develop a methodology for family outreach in Sabratha, and establish a follow up grant which will seek to implement this methodology directly.LTI has conducted outreach for trainers for this specialized activity, and has secured the collaboration of two organizations with significant experience in training and setting up family support groups – but also doing this in North Africa with families with direct exposure to extremist groups. The World Organization Against Torture and Room to Heal have previously collaborated to set up family self-support networks for the families of departed or incarcerated militants in Tunisia, and they have an ongoing MoU with the Tunisian Ministry of Social Affairs. These organizations are uniquely placed to offer a tailored training program, and also the possibility of a visit to one of the Tunisian Centers for Social Integration and Support – which work with these communities on a regular basis.By working with this group of trainers and Libyan social workers, LTI will continue to refine and expand its programs in Sabratha and support the staff of OKLES to identify, engage with, and support for a small number of selected families. This training will help equip local social workers,psychologists and teachers with the tools for their ongoing work with families in Sabratha, to help empower them with tools to reject and respond to violent extremism.

",Spotlight on the Local Governance - Supporting Tripoli MC Public Outreach,"
Since the signing of the Libya Political Agreement (LPA) in late 2015, Libya’s political future is hopeful but fragile. A new Government of National Accord (GNA) is working to help the country recover from two years of violent conflict between regional political factions. Despite strong support from the international community, powerful spoilers – particularly in the East – continue to challenge the GNA. Also, entrenched disdain for national level governance and rapidly eroding quality of life undermines the GNA’s credibility. Meanwhile, municipal councils have assumed significant governance responsibilities over the past 2 years, and they are still viewed as the most credible institutions. However, they face serious challenges in providing services to their constituents and are disconnected from national level counterparts and other local actors. Finally, the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security dysfunction to strengthen its influence.
At the local level, municipal councils have tried to fill the gap left by absent national governance since 2014, and they remain Libya's most legitimate and functional democratic bodies. According to recent LTI 2-sponsored research, 55% of Libyans view municipal councils as legitimate. Yet, that legitimacy is eroding, as most MCs lack the resources to provide basic services and are detached from both national institutions, other local governance actors, and constituents. In response, LTI is supporting MCs and their partners to bolster the two critical pillars of effective local governance – basic service delivery and public outreach and communications. According to LTI 2 research, these are the two factors most correlated with public confidence in local governance. As a part of these activities, LTI 2 is facilitating relationships between national ministries and local actors to strengthen the long term institutional channels for the flow of resources and technical capacity to the local level. In addition, under the “Our Shared Responsibility” campaign, LTI 2 is helping MCs build a collaborative, participatory approach to governance involving civil society, tribal leaders, neighborhood councils, national representatives, and constituents. Where MC leadership is unsettled, LTI 2 is working more closely with community level actors to strengthen participatory governance and basic services. This includes CSOs, neighborhood councils, and ministry representatives, where possible.
To help partner municipal councils more effectively communicate with their constituents, LTI 2 is partnering with the International Republican Institute (IRI) throughout 2016 on a cluster of strategic communications projects for councils. IRI has sponsored a week-long seminar for MCs in Tripoli, Sabratha, the East, and the South to help MCs develop a basic strategic communications plan. Most MCs have now reviewed and approved those plans, and LTI 2 is helping MCs develop and fund specific activities based on those plans. One of those municipalities is Tripoli Center. The municipality of Tripoli Center (MTC) has been very active in service delivery projects and in assuming responsibilities that are shifting from the national level to MCs. However, only 12% of residents have a strong or fair amount of knowledge about MTC according to recent LTI 2 research. Even though the MCs has attempted to communicate with its constituents, they have limited capacity and have never implemented strategic communications plans that outline the audiences, tools, and messages. 
Under this activity LTI 2 will support MTC to produce 5 creative videos and promote the videos on the Council FB page and TV stations. While the topics of the videos will be determined in the implementation phase, the videos will highlight the work of the council in different projects around the municipality, including the facilitation and coordination between community and the national level ministries. In addition, through this activity, MTC will support the University of Tripoli Student Union (UTSU) to organize ‘’Masarat’’ exhibition for specialties and professions in October 2016. The exhibition will introduce all the schools, colleges, and institutions that offer a variety of specialties and professions for students and young job-seeks, including former militia members. MTC is supporting the UTSU to provide necessary facilitation for the exhibition. The exhibition is also an opportunity for the MTC to interact directly with the community - especially youth - and advertise their effort to help the community and build linkages between community and the National level government. MTC will have a stand at the exhibition to show videos and distribute booklets and flyers and lead the media plan as the main donor of the exhibition. LTI2 will support the MTC with the printing materials needed for the exhibition.

To acheive this objective, LTI 2 will support the MOE, Ben Walid MC, and Tripoli MCs to refurbish nine schools with maintenance and equipment in order to improve the capacity of these schools to accept Sirte IDP students. This activity targets  schools of Tripoli MCs districts including Abu Slim and Ain Zara, also Ben Walid city, as they are the areas with the most Sirte IDPs children. LTI2 will support painting, installation of windows, doors, toilets, kitchen facilities and air-conditioning units and provide furniture, learning boards, and stationary to increasing the number classrooms in these schools. In addition, LTI 2 will support public outreach meetings between the MOE, local authorities, and IDP community. This activity will help build the IDP’s confidence in the GNA and MOE by providing a tangible and highly visible service that will involve an outreach campaign and promote stronger engagement between all parties including IDPs, local authorities, MOE, and the  GNA.

IF the MOE, Ben Walid MC. and Tripoli MCs refurbish schools with maintenance and equipment to improve the capacity of these schools to accept IDP students and hold public outreach meetings, THEN we will increase awareness among Sirte IDPs of the MOE's efforts to work with local authorities to address Sirte student needs BECAUSE:
•	IDPs and residents will correctly attribute this activity to the appropriate MCs, MOE, and the GNA.
•The project is high visibility and high priority for IDP families, and IDP families will remain in these locations for at least the duration of the school year
•	We assume that schools would register more IDPs students after the refurbishments of the extra classrooms and the activity will reduce overcrowding for both local residents and IDPs.
•	IDPs currently lack information about the GNA, MOE, and municipal councils' cooperation efforts in addressing their needs.
•	MOE wants to respond but have very limited resources, and that assistance may be inadequate without external support.

Since the signing of the Libya Political Agreement (LPA) in late 2015, Libya’s political future is hopeful but fragile. A new Government of National Accord (GNA) is working to help the country recover from two years of violent conflict between regional political factions. Despite strong support from the international community, powerful spoilers – particularly in the East – continue to challenge the GNA. Also, entrenched disdain for national level governance and rapidly eroding quality of life undermines the GNA’s credibility. Meanwhile, municipal councils have assumed significant governance responsibilities over the past 2 years, and they are still viewed as the most credible institutions. However, they face serious challenges in providing services to their constituents and are disconnected from national level counterparts and other local actors. Finally, the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security dysfunction to strengthen its influence.
At the national level, the new GNA is struggling to gain legitimacy and authority, largely because of its weak capacity for public outreach and communications. Meanwhile powerful detractors continue to grow in influence, undermine the GNA, and spread misinformation. Furthermore, successive rounds of polling in Libya have revealed strong disdain for national political institutions and actors, and Libyans are disillusioned with the failure of previous national transitional efforts. In response, LTI 2 is helping the GNA and its proponents at the local level educate people about its mandate, engage ordinary Libyans in the political transition process, and communicate its progress in addressing citizens’ priorities. Specifically, at the national level, LTI 2 is focusing on direct support the Presidency Council in its public outreach and communications efforts – primarily through the PC media office and GNA ministries. 
The Islamic State has grown considerably in Libya during the last two years as local jihadi groups pledged allegiance to IS. One such group in Sirte joined IS last fall and has promoted itself as the “Tripoli Province” of the Islamic State. Recently, IS instituted a more strict observance of shariah in the City, confiscating equipment and material from houses that could be deemed ‘haram’ (illegal), and Sirte became increasingly isolated from the rest of Libya, leading to dire shortages of food, money and medicine. Many residents fled, abandoning all belongings behind. Around 25,000 displaced families arrived to Ben Jawad in the east, Misrata, Tarhouna, Khoms, Bani Walid and most recently in Tripoli. Around 2500 families arrived to Tajoura and Abou Salim and Tripoli Center. There is tremendous pressure on the GNA and their local governance partners to aid these families. 
Since June, LTI 2 has worked closely with GNA ministries, local host municipal councils, and the Sirte Crisis Committee to respond to urgent IDP needs - distributing foodbaskets to nearly 1,000 IDP families during Ramadan and providing school kits to displaced children in early October under TIP040. These local governance actors have gained enormous attention and positive reception from the support for IDPs under these activities. Now, one of the most significant challenges is the lack of spaces in schools for IDP children in the cities they have fled to. Although the suburbs of Sirte are liberated and some IDPs are returning, a significant number of them wouldn’t be able to return this educational year due to the long reconstruction process and the security arrangements which will take place in the city. This means that IDPs will need to be accommodated in schools at their displaced locations for the upcoming year. 
In this activity, LTI2 is assisting the Bani Walid and Tripoli area municipal councils, Sirte Crisis Commitee and the Ministry of education with in-kind support to refurbish and equip nine schools in Ben Walid and Tripoli, promote the MOE’s and the GNA’s efforts to respond to the needs of the IDPs of Sirte. Refurbishment will include painting, installation of new windows and doors, providing toilet and kitchen facilities and air-conditioning units. Equipment supplied will include furniture, learning boards, and stationary. This activity will increase the number of classrooms in these schools to accept Sirte IDPs students. Sirte IDP students will be integrated into the rest of the population in these schools. This activity will build the IDP’s confidence in the MOE by providing a tangible and highly visible service that will involve an outreach campaign and promote stronger engagement between all parties including IDPs, local authorities, MOE, and the  GNA.

In this activity, Sabratah MC and media office will organize and promote a community improvement project competition among local CSOs and provide partial funding for the best projects. The immediate goal of this activity is for the Sabratha MC and its media office to facilitate a community process involving residents, civil society, and other local government actors to engage them in the work of the MC. Despite the MC's high-profile efforts in the past year to deliver services and resolve conflict in the city, nearly two-thirds of residents said they knew nothing or very little about the MC according to an LTI survey in 2016. Thus, this activity will help address that issue with a high-profile effort to facilitate effective communication and interaction between the MC and a broad range of civil society groups - which are a critical link between local government authorities and residents. LTI 2 will partner with the MC to equip and empower the media office to organize and heavily promote this community improvement project competition among active CSOs. LTI 2 will support the media office with some equipment to produce videos about the initiative, advertising materials, and logistical support to conduct the outreach efforts and community event. In addition, LTI 2 and the MC will provide partial funding for the top 3 community improvement projects.

IF Sabratha MC and media office organize and promote a community improvement project competition, THEN Sabratha MC and media office will facilitate a community process involving residents, civil society, and other local government actors to engage them in the work of the MC. This will contribute to the MC's effective communication with citizens.
ASSUMPTIONS: 
• Sabratha MC wants to improve the capacity of its Media office and provide ongoing resources and capacity building for better performance.
• Residents and he MC are interested in communication with each other. However, residents do not have much information about the MC or what it does, as LTI has discovered from survey results. From the MC side, they lack both capacity and resources for communication.
• The media office is an important bridge between the MC and residents. Equipping and empowering them to facilitate and promote this initiative will give them the opportunity to interact with many different residents, CSOs, and community leaders - strengthening these relationships. So, it will build their capacity to promote and communicate about other MC efforts and projects in the future. 
• The community competition will be an effective opportunity for MC to interact directly with many representatives of different groups in the city. We assume the CSOs involved will represent many different constituencies, interests, and neighborhoods, and this process will be an important opportunity for interaction and relationship-building. This direct interaction is a more effective means of communication
• The strong involvement of the civil society sector is critical here, as we assume that civil society groups can serve as an important link between local government authorities and the MC, and civil society groups play an important role in representing and mobilizing various constituencies.
• This activity involves and will fund some small community improvement projects. However, the key focus of the activity is not the service delivery processes. The key focus of the activity is strengthening the media office's communication capacity and facilitating the MC's interaction with the public through this competition process. 
• The MC's strategic communication plan (which these activities fall under) is an effective plan for better engaging with constituents.

However, they face serious challenges in providing services to their constituents and are disconnected from national level counterparts and other local actors. Finally, the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security dysfunction to strengthen its influence.
At the local level, municipal councils have tried to fill the gap left by absent national governance since 2014, and they remain Libya's most legitimate and functional democratic bodies. According to recent LTI 2-sponsored research, 55% of Libyans view municipal councils as legitimate. Yet, that legitimacy is eroding, as most MCs lack the resources to provide basic services and are detached from both national institutions, other local governance actors, and constituents. In response, LTI is supporting MCs and their partners to bolster the two critical pillars of effective local governance – basic service delivery and public outreach and communications. According to LTI 2 research, these are the two factors most correlated with public confidence in local governance. As a part of these activities, LTI 2 is facilitating relationships between national ministries and local actors to strengthen the long term institutional channels for the flow of resources and technical capacity to the local level. In addition, under the “Our Shared Responsibility” campaign, LTI 2 is helping MCs build a collaborative, participatory approach to governance involving civil society, tribal leaders, neighborhood councils, national representatives, and constituents. Where MC leadership is unsettled, LTI 2 is working more closely with community level actors to strengthen participatory governance and basic services. This includes CSOs, neighborhood councils, and ministry representatives, where possible. 

To help partner municipal councils more effectively communicate with their constituents, LTI 2 is partnering with the International Republican Institute (IRI) throughout 2016 on a cluster of strategic communications projects for councils. IRI has sponsored a week-long seminar for MCs in Tripoli, Sabratha, the East, and the South to help MCs develop a basic strategic communications plan. Most MCs have now reviewed and approved those plans, and LTI 2 is helping MCs develop and fund specific activities based on those plans. One of those municipalities is Sabratha. Sabratha has been very active in service delivery projects and in assuming responsibilities that are shifting from the national level to MCs. Also, Sabratha MC has become an active force against extremist ideologies and presence in Sabratha. The Municipal Council has fostered dialogue between different tribes and groups in an effort to create a united front against extremism and prevent the re-establishment of any safe havens in the city. Despite these high-profile efforts nearly two-thirds of residents said they knew nothing or very little about the MC and a majority were dissatisfied with the MC's services according to an LTI survey in 2016.As part of its Strategic Communication plan, Sabratha MC aims to build ties directly with its residents by enhancing the capacity of its media office. One of the MC's first initiatives under this plan is to equip and empower the media office to organize and promote a civil society competition for small community improvement projects in the city. LTI 2 will partner with the MC to support the MC media office in this initiative. The MC and MC media office will form a joint committee to supervise the entire project. The media office will advertise the competition heavily among the public and active CSOs to encourage 15-20 organizations to develop and submit proposals for small community improvement projects, which the MC will fund. The media office will provide a proposal writing and fundraising workshop for interested organizations to make sure all applicants get an equal opportunity on providing adequate projects. Finalist organizations will be invited to present their projects in a community gathering event, and the event will gather civil society actors and community leaders to vote for the best three projects. LTI 2 will support hall rent and catering for the gathering, as well as partial financial support for the best projects. In addition, LTI will provide a lot of support to the media office to promote the work of the MC while organizing this initiative. The media office will produce 3-4 small videos about the effort and promote videos in FB, all under #our sheared responsibility campaign. They will also be arranging coverage for the initiative through local radio and television outlets. Finally, the media office will develop and print an MC guidance booklet which will be distributed throughout the project.

In this activity, LTI 2 will work with the Municipal Council to ensure Souq al Juma residents are better informed about the municipal council's work and achievements. To achieve this objectives, Souq al Juma MC will produce and distribute videos and materials under the ""Our Shared Responsibility"" campaign to promote  the MC achievements, equip the MC media office, and work with the Scouts on public outreach campaigns. LTI 2 will support the municipal council by helping them fund a production company to produce five 1-2 minute videos about MC achievements and facilitate distribution of the videos on social media through the MC facebook page and local television. In addition, LTI 2 will help the MC equip the media office, which has been very active in producing materials to help the MC communicate with the public. In this activity specifically, the media office will design printed materials to accompany the videos. Finally, the MC, media office and the Scouts will work together on at least 3 public outreach campaigns likely at schools or public places to distribute materials and talk about the MC. Souq al Juma MC has been very active in service delivery projects and in assuming responsibilities that are shifting from the national level to MCs in cooperation with ministries. However, only about 24% of residents have a strong or fair amount of knowledge about the MC according to recent LTI 2 research. This activity will be an important part of LTI 2 efforts to help municipal councils communicate more effectively with citizens.

IF Souq al Juma MC produces and distributes videos and materials to promote the MC achievements, equips the MC media office, and works with the Scouts on public outreach campaign, THEN Souq al Juma residents are better informed about the municipal council's work and achievements.  BECAUSE: 
• Citizens are interested in learning about what the MC is doing and will pay attention to information about what their MC is doing.
• The Scouts is a neutral and reliable entity for citizens and they can help bridge the gap as a CSO between ordinary citizens and the MC.
• The videos shared on social media and TV will be an effective means for sharing information about the MC's achievements.
• The MC's strategic communication plan (which these activities fall under) is an effective plan for better engaging with constituents.
• MC media office will use the resources effectively and continue to be active in leading outreach efforts for the MC.


",Spotlight on the Local Governance - Souq al Juma Public Outreach,"
Since the signing of the Libya Political Agreement (LPA) in late 2015, Libya’s political future is hopeful but fragile. A new Government of National Accord (GNA) is working to help the country recover from two years of violent conflict between regional political factions. Despite strong support from the international community, powerful spoilers – particularly in the East – continue to challenge the GNA. Also, entrenched disdain for national level governance and rapidly eroding quality of life undermines the GNA’s credibility. Meanwhile, municipal councils have assumed significant governance responsibilities over the past 2 years, and they are still viewed as the most credible institutions. However, they face serious challenges in providing services to their constituents and are disconnected from national level counterparts and other local actors. Finally, the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State taking advantage of the governance and security dysfunction to strengthen its influence.
At the local level, municipal councils have tried to fill the gap left by absent national governance since 2014, and they remain Libya's most legitimate and functional democratic bodies.

IRI has sponsored a week-long seminar for MCs in Tripoli, Sabratha, the East, and the South to help MCs develop a basic strategic communications plan. Most MCs have now reviewed and approved those plans, and LTI 2 is helping MCs develop and fund specific activities based on those plans. One of those municipalities is Souq al Juma. Souq al Juma has been very active in service delivery projects and in assuming responsibilities that are shifting from the national level to MCs. However, only about 24% of residents have a strong or fair amount of knowledge about the MC according to recent LTI 2 research. Even though the MC has attempted to communicate with its constituents, they have limited capacity and have never implemented strategic communications plans that outline the audiences, tools, and messages. 
Under this activity LTI 2 will support Souq al Jouma MC to produce 5 creative videos (1-2 minutes each) and promote the videos on the Council FB page and TV stations. While the topics of the videos will be determined in the implementation phase based on municipal council vote, the videos will highlight the work of the council in different projects around the municipality, including the facilitation and coordination between the community and the national level ministries. In addition, the MC design team of the MC media office has been very active in providing creative outreach materials for different municipal projects and have been one of their strengths but lack proper equipment which hindered the quality and speed of their work. To enhance their performance, under this grant the MC will provide the team with a few critical pieces of equipment and software to continue producing the outreach materials for the MC different projects, and the office will also be in charge of providing all needed printing material to this project. In addition, through this activity Souq al Jouma MC will form a partnership with the Scouts of Souq al Jouma to conduct number of outreach/awareness campaign in different topics. During the implementation of this activity the MC and the Scouts will meet to select outreach 3 outreach campaigns topics and put together their plan for cooperation. The outreach will likely be conducted by the Scouts through schools and other public places and highlight the work of the MC - complementing the videos. The Scouts have been perceived as neutral partner and widely accepted among community. This will be an opportunity for the MC to interact easily with the community - especially youth - and advertise their effort to help the community and build linkages between community and the National level government.

This activity aims to increase interaction between youth (ages 18-25) from communities in conflict and increase support for local peace and reconciliation efforts. In order to achieve this objective, LTI will work with Sabratha MC, Sabratha Scouts, and other area MCs and CSOs to conduct a 3-day youth exchange event in key western Libya towns, including Zawia, Ajilat, Zintan, Zuwarah and Sabratha,  Around 110 youth (7-8 participants from 15 municipalities each) will participate in a 3-day ""caravan"" that will visit different towns in the region to distribute outreach materials reinforcing the reconciliation agreement and conduct a small, half-day community service activity celebrating unity and reconciliation. In addition, local MCs and CSOs will host dialogue sessions each evening, and a strong media component will highlight the effort throughout Western Libya. Working through youth, these activities will improve social cohesion, cooperation, and mutual trust between these different areas, and will be publicized as part of a series of events which seek to encourage nascent reconciliation processes. In strengthening area reconciliation in Sabratha and surrounding towns, LTI and it local partners will make it easier for communities to reject extremism and reduce the space for violent extremist groups to operate.

IF Sabratha MC, Sabratha Scouts, and other area MCs and CSOs conduct a 3-day youth exchange event in key western Libya towns, including Zawia, Ajilat, Zintan, Zuwarah and Sabratha, THEN this will increase interaction between youth from communities in conflict and increase support for local peace and reconciliation efforts. BECAUSE:• Youth from western Libya towns are willing to interact and address issues peacefully.•	 The interaction between youth in a positive environment will lead to stronger relationships between the youth and their communities. •	A decreased likelihood of local conflicts will allow people and communities to more easily reject violent extremism.•Extremist groups are less able to operate in communities which are not in conflict with one another.•	CSOs and youth groups will be connected and inspired from the high-profile effort to continue with other initiatives which deepen local peace.•The exchange event will include a diverse group of influential youth representing different communities who have been party to the conflict.
",Sabratha Youth Exchange for Peace,"
The faltering of Libya’s post-revolution political transition and the spread of violent conflict in 2014 created space for extremist groups already present in Libya to expand their influence and control. Networks of salafi-jihadi groups emerged in many of Libya’s coastal cities after the revolution. In the east, where these groups were strongest, jihadi groups with links to international organizations vied for control of cities such as Derna and Benghazi. In central Libya, the Islamic State (IS) took advantage of local conflicts in Sirte to seize control of the city. In western Libya, salafi-jihadi networks have remained embedded in complex and overlapping networks of political Islamists, apolitical Salafists, revolutionary brigades and political groupings. While the Islamic State remains deeply unpopular in Libya, a variety of extremist groups, some with links to IS and international organizations, remain embedded in local communities and conflicts. Understanding the local contexts and drivers of groups toward extremism is essential to designing effecting programming aimed at countering violent extremism (CVE).LTI 2 conducted a rigorous assessment of the drivers of violent extremism in western Libya. This assessment showed that many of our assumptions regarding the social, political and economic factors driving extremism are incorrect. Contrary to conventional wisdom, those expressing support for militias and extremist groups reported significantly higher levels of social and political engagement, lower levels of disillusion with the revolution, were less sensitive to corruption and did not report feeling discriminated against. These findings suggest that macro-level interventions based on providing employment opportunities or fostering more community or political engagement are unlikely to support progress toward CVE objectives. Successful CVE interventions should be focused on the community and family level and should seek to reduce the conducive environment for violent extremism by addressing local conflicts. Interventions must disrupt networks that support violent extremism by giving families and communities the tools to identify and support those at risk of radicalization and provide alternatives to extremism.In Sabratha, the municipal council has become in recent months a more active force against extremist ideologies and presence, and the MC has been particularly active in reducing conducive environment for extremism by taking the leading in resolving regional conflicts. Since the US airstrike on 19 February 2016, the Municipal Council has fostered dialogue between different tribes and groups in an effort to create a united front against extremism and prevent the re-establishment of any safe havens in the city. More recently, LTI 2 supported the Municipal Council to conduct a peace festival (TIP044) that brought together representatives from 12 different municipalities in in western Libya. During this festival, representatives from the 12 municipalities celebrated the 2015 local peace agreements and recommitted their communities to working towards peace in the region. These efforts will help counter violent extremism, as it will reduce the probability of a return to violent conflict and remove grievances that could be exploited by extremist groups.While the Festival of Peace reinforced support for and commitment to peace among local community and tribal leaders, this activity seeks to deepen reconciliation between communities that were formerly in conflict by developing connections between youth (ages 18-25) in these different communities. To do so, this activity will support a three-day youth exchange activity sponsored by the Sabratha Scouts and made up of youth from Sabratha, Ajilat, Zawia, Zuwarah, Zintan, and other smaller towns and supported by the Municipal Councils and relevant local CSOs in these towns. Around 110 youth (7-8 participants from 15 municipalities each) will participate in a 3-day ""caravan"" that will visit different towns in the region to distribute outreach materials reinforcing the peace efforts and conduct a small community service activity, such as a public mural or garden to commemorate unity and reconciliation. In addition, the participating MCs, Scouts, and CSOs will help host dialogue discussions with the youth each night of the exchange activity. The capstone event will be a football tournament on the third day in Sabratha. Working through youth, these activities will serve to improve communications, cooperation, and mutual trust between these different areas, and will be publicized as part of a series of events which seek to deepen local peace and encourage nascent reconciliation processes.

The activity will support OKLES center in Sabratha to equip families impacted by violent extremism in Sabratha with access to tools and resources to address problems contributing to violent extremism at the family and community level. The persistence of violent extremism in Sabratha has less to do with socioeconomic or political drivers than with durable networks at the community level and family relationships. Finding a way to break this cycle of radicalization will require empowering families and communities with tools to confront extremism. Thus, LTI 2 is providing support to OKLES center for 3 months as it launches and facilitates family support groups in Sabratha. The primary purpose of the groups is to equip families with access to psychosocial support information and resources for children and youth at risk of engaging in violence or extremism. In addition, the groups will break down the stigma and barriers to discussing these problems in Sabratha and forge positive connections across families dealing with these issues. OKLES is employing a few different methods to establish trust with impacted families and engage adult family members in the groups: (1) ongoing play therapy and psychosocial support to children at their center, (2) an outreach campaign through 12 schools, (3) community festival, (4) an interactive website, and (5) a partnership with the souq al-juma'a rehabilitation center in Tripoli. This activity builds upon 2 previous activities LTI 2 conducted to support OKLES - in kind support to establish the center for children and intensive training for 11 staff members in psychosocial support and facilitation in Tunis. LTI 2 will support OKLES with staffing support, material and outreach for the festival, and materials for the rehabilitation center. By providing access to psychosocial support and resources for families impacted by violent extremis, LTI 2 aims to help communities in Sabratha have increased capacity to reject extremism.

IF OKLES develops family support groups, conducts a school outreach and a community festival, and provides support to the Souq al Jum'aa rehabilitation center, THEN families impacted by violent extremism in Sabratha have access to tools and resources to address the issues at the family and community level
BECAUSE:

• Residents in Sabratha are looking for opportunities and support to reject violence and extremism in their community.

• OKLES staff have received training in the right tools and best practices to facilitate this support to families.

• The partnership with the rehabilitation center will strengthen OKLES ability to specifically target the families most in need.  



• The festival and school outreach campaign will provide more opportunities for OKLES to engage additional families in need of this support.

The persistence of violent extremism in Sabratha has less to do with socioeconomic or political drivers than with durable networks at the community level and family relationships. Several families have featured prominently in support for extremism in Sabratha, some across generations. Finding a way to break this cycle of radicalization will require empowering families and communities with tools to confront extremism.  Since July 2016, LTI 2 LTI has partnered with a local group - Organisation of Knowledge Light for Education and Science (OKLES) - in Sabratha to provide support to families affected by conflict and extremism through supporting a school and family outreach center. With the strong support of the Sabratha Municipal Council, the school is providing psychosocial support to more than 160 children in Sabratha impacted by violence and extremism. Through working with the children, OKLES built relationships with parents and families and started to identify participants in family support groups. In October, OKLES and LTI 2 hosted a training in Tunis for 11 core teachers, social workers, and psychologists, to tailor and deepen their professional expertise for facilitating these support groups. LTI 2 sponsored a structured three-day training on small group interventions for families affected by extremism, and a two day of training on “play therapy” to work with children most affected by conflict. During this training, the OKLES participants worked with experienced Tunisian and international trainers to discuss tools and methods for family outreach in Sabratha.Thus, in this activity, LTI 2 will support OKLES center and their staff for 3 months as they implement the family outreach approach they worked on during the TIP045 training in Tunis. The main task of the staff over the next quarter will be the family outreach process and developing family outreach groups, building upon the foundation established in TIP043 (opening of the center and initial outreach through children) and TIP045 (training for staff). Family outreach groups will focus on addressing trauma and the family and community-level effects of violence and extremism in Sabratha. In addition to the ongoing activities at the House of the Child to provide psychosocial support to children, OKLES staff will also conduct a few other activities to promote and facilitate the development of the family support groups and family outreach, as described in the implementation plan. These components include (1) an interactive website (2) outreach to 12 schools in Sabratha (3) a community festival to reach additional families not previously reached under TIP043, and (4) establishment of a collaboration with the souk el jema rehabilitation center, where many Sabratha youth impacted by violent extremism have spent time receiving psychosocial support and training.

This activity aims to increase public confidence in Abu Salim Municipal Council's ability to address critical service delivery needs in cooperation with relevant national government institutions. Specifically, this project  aims to increase confidence among residents of Kashouni, Al-Jebs, and Mothalet Al-Rabesh neighborhoods, In order to achieve this objective, LTI 2 will provide Abu Salim Municipal Council with new sewage equipment and accessories for these three neighborhoods in cooperation with the Public Water and Sanitation Company, which is under the GNA General Authority for Water Resources. The Public Water and Sanitation Company and the municipal council will be responsible for all installation and maintenance. Wastewater and sewage flooding in Kashouni, Al-Jebs and Mothalet Al-Rabesh areas in Abu Salim is a highly visible public problem, which often floods streets and leads to potential public health problems. According to the municipal council’s environmental sanitation office, failure to replace equipment such as pipelines, sewage manholes, pumps, valves, cables, etc will result in the contamination of groundwater and long-term health and environmental issues. Kashouni, Al-Jebs and Mothalet Al-Rabesh are also the most densely populated areas in Abu Salim which host 50,000 residents. In addition to more than 1000 IDPs from different cities which causes more pressure on the public utilities. These areas has also the most damaged drainage system in Abu Salim. The drainage broken pipelines in addition to causing contamination of groundwater it has also damaged the underground electricity cables and polluted residents drinking water. In order to amplify the project’s impact and strengthen residents' confidence in the council, the project will include designing and printing of flyers to educate people about the council’s service delivery efforts and a video showing the before and after effects under #our shared responsibility campaign. In addition, the council will hold a town-hall meeting at the beginning of the project to discuss the new improvements the council is implementing in cooperation with the Public Water Company to gain residents support during implementation. This activity is an opportunity for Abu Salim Municipal Council to provide critical basic services benefiting a large segment of the population and showcase for citizen’s collaboration between national level government institutions and the council. These efforts will strengthen residents’ confidence in the council in the target three neighborhoods.

At the local level, municipal councils have tried to fill the gap left by absent national governance since 2014, and they remain Libya's most legitimate and functional democratic bodies. According to recent LTI 2-sponsored research, 55% of Libyans view municipal councils as legitimate. Yet, that legitimacy is eroding, as most MCs lack the resources to provide basic services and are detached from both national institutions, other local governance actors, and constituents. In response, LTI is supporting MCs and their partners to bolster the two critical pillars of effective local governance – basic service delivery and public outreach and communications. According to LTI 2 research, these are the two factors most correlated with public confidence in local governance. As a part of these activities, LTI 2 is facilitating relationships between national ministries and local actors to strengthen the long term institutional channels for the flow of resources and technical capacity to the local level. In addition, under the “Our Shared Responsibility” campaign, LTI 2 is helping MCs build a collaborative, participatory approach to governance involving civil society, tribal leaders, neighborhood councils, national representatives, and constituents. 
Abu Salim is a low-income and highly populated neighborhood in greater Tripoli. The Municipal Council was elected in 2014 and consists of 9 Council members (1 female) and 60 Abu Salim Council employees (20 female). Abu Salim MC has been very active in projects to start building its relationship with its residents and assume service delivery responsibilities that are shifting from the national level to the local level. Still, challenges exist, particularly with the municipality's aging infrastructure. The rapid growth of urban population has put heavy pressure on public utilities like sanitation. In addition, the population has swelled in the past few years, as Abu Salim neighborhood has hosted many IDP families from Sirte and other areas. The sewage and drainage system does not extend to some places and is very old in others. Sewage and rainwater often floods the streets, especially in winter, which leads to contamination of water. If not addressed, this problem will result in health and environmental issues in the long run per the Office of environmental Sanitation of Abu Salim MC. The resulting problems include spread of insects and reptiles, possible groundwater contamination, and closure of roads. With very limited financial resources the municipal council coordinates quite often with the Public Water and Sanitation company to provide temporary solutions and aims to continue this coordination to solve the problem permanently. In Tripoli, The Public Water and Sanitation Company is a national level authority that is subordinated to the General Authority for Water Resources of the GNA.
In this activity, LTI 2 will provide Abu Salim MC with materials to address the highly visible problem of waste water and sewage flooding in Al-Kashouni, Al-Jebs, and Mothalet Al-Rabesh areas. These three areas host an estimated 50,000 residents. Kashouni, Al-Jebs, and Mothalet Al-Rabesh neighborhoods are the most densely populated areas in Abu Salim which host 50,000 residents. In addition to more than 1000 IDPs from different cities which causes more pressure on the public utilities. These areas has also the most damaged drainage system in Abu Salim. The drainage broken pipelines caused contamination of groundwater in addition to damaging the electricity cables and polluted the resident’s drinking water. LTI 2 will purchase sewage pumps, pipes, valves, and other accessories for the three major neighborhoods in cooperation with the Public Water and Sanitation Company. LTI 2 will support the council to design and print flyers to educate residents about the project and the role of citizens in helping maintain local utilities. The MC will also produce a video showcasing service projects implemented under the “Our Shared Responsibility” campaign. In addition, the MC will hold a town-hall meeting at the beginning of the project inform citizens about the MC’s efforts in cooperation with the Public Water Company to gain residents’ support during implementation. This activity will be an opportunity for Abu Salim MC to resolve a highly visible, priority public service problem and inform citizens about collaboration between national and local authorities to address it.

Without adequate national resources to provide services, local governance bodies struggle to earn confidence of citizens. This activity aims to increase confidence among school students and their families in the Abu Salim MC and Ministry of Education's (MOE) ability to deliver basic services. LTI 2 will provide in-kind equipment like flooring, seating, and trash receptacles to support the MC and the MOE’s upgrades to recreation and common spaces at Attahrir and Al-Eslah school spaces in Abu Salim, a poorer and historically Gadafist community. The MC, in coordination with the General Services Company and MOE, will conduct the preparation work and oversee the process. LTI 2 will also support a strong public outreach campaign to highlight the refurbishment efforts and to promote the cooperation between the government institutions involved (Ministry of Education, General Services Company/MOLG, and Abu Salim MC). This activity will contribute to LTI 2 efforts to increase confidence in the participatory basic service delivery process.

If Abu Salim Municipal Council and the MOE upgrade common spaces and recreational areas in public schools, 

THEN students and families will have increased confidence in the Abu Salim MC and the MOE to deliver basic services 

BECAUSE:

•	MOE and MC is willing to support the schools in Abu Slim but lack the resources. 

•	This is a high priority need for students, parents, and schools in Abu Salim based on the demands the MC and residents have submitted to the MOE.

•	The government institutions will cooperate with each other. 

•	The information and outreach campaign will provide the opportunity for public awareness of the activity. Per LTI research, communications in combination with service delivery correlates most closely with public confidence in local governance.

Abu Salim is a neighborhood on the southern edge of Tripoli, controlled by Ghneiwa, a force upon which the GNA relies for security.  Due to remnant camps for foreign labor, the area has also seen an influx of IDPs from across the country, which the MC is poorly positioned to respond to, as Abu Salim is a low-income neighborhood previously associated with Gaddafi supporters.  . It is a large area of Tripoli, with over 400,000 residents, and Abu Salim MC has actively pursued projects to start building its relationship with its community and improving deliver basic services despite the absence of strong national centralized government and lack of resources in general. The education sector is one of the most urgent priorities that Abu Salim MC and the Ministry of Education are trying to address, as schools in Abu Salim been overwhelmed by students due to rapid growth and it being one of the top recipients of IDP inflows. Since the Ministry of Education (MOE) lacks adequate resources from the national government, it was unable to respond to the Abu Salim municipality’s school maintenance needs, specifically dilapidated and unsafe recreational and common spaces for children. With the goal of increasing confidence in local governance, LTI will support the Ministry of Education and the MC to respond to Abu Salim demands and brings both sides together to coordinate and effectively work together. 
In this activity, LTI2 is assisting the Ministry of Education, Abu Salim MC, and the Ministry of Local Governance (MoLG) with in-kind support for the upgrade of 2 school spaces including installation of flooring, chairs/benches, garbage containers and sport accessories. Furthermore, LTI 2 will support a strong public information campaign between Abu Salim MC, the schools staff, parents of the students, national ministries (MOE and MOLG) in order to increase cooperation among the government institutions and community representatives in responding to the priority needs the community brings to the local authorities. This activity will build the residents' confidence in ministry officials and Abu Salim MC by providing a tangible and highly visible service that will involve an outreach campaign and promote stronger engagement between all parties including residents, local authorities and ministry representatives.

Since the signing of the Libya Political Agreement (LPA) in late 2015, Libya’s political future is hopeful but fragile. A new Government of National Accord (GNA) is working to help the country recover from two years of violent conflict between regional political factions. Despite strong support from the international community, powerful spoilers – particularly in the East – continue to challenge the GNA. Also, entrenched disdain for national level governance and rapidly eroding quality of life undermines the GNA’s credibility. Meanwhile, municipal councils have assumed significant governance responsibilities over the past 2 years, and they are still viewed as the most credible institutions. However, they face serious challenges in providing services to their constituents and are disconnected from national level counterparts and other local actors. Finally, the fragmentation in Libya’s governance landscape has facilitated the rise of extremism in Libya, with the Islamic State and other extremist groups taking advantage of governance and security dysfunction to strengthen its influence.

The Municipality of Tripoli Central (MTC) was elected in May 2014, and it consists of 10 members (one female) and 40 council staff (12 female). MTC has been very active in projects to start building its relationship with its community and assume responsibilities that are shifting from the national level to MCs. Still, challenges exist.  The municipality is considered one of the highest populated areas in greater Tripoli. The number of schools has reached 65 schools with different levels. However, most of the schools are old and require constant maintenance. The schools are attended by students from both inside and outside of the municipality, which strains the schools. Lack of funds has undermined the Ministry of Education (MOE) ability to provide the required maintenance. The capacity of Tripoli MC to obtain funds from different sources has made the MC a reliable partner that MOE can rely upon for assistance in such circumstances. Thus far, the MC provided the 2017 curriculum material for most of greater Tripoli schools, conducted a number of activities for students such as schools competitions, honoring the most outstanding students among Tripoli center schools and workshops to improve the quality of education, and provided maintenance for 7 kindergartens. Recently, the health committee of the MC recommended prioritization of clean restrooms for students, as well as providing windows for some of the classroom, to improve conditions of the educational environment.
In this activity, LTI2 will provide MTC and the Ministry of Education with in-kind support to refurbish 20 schools in Tripoli Center. The refurbishment includes repairing restrooms, doors, and windows. LTI 2 will provide MTC with light bulbs, toilets, sinks, windows, window and doors locks, and other basic equipment.  The MTC, in coordination with MOE, will provide all labor and management of the refurbishment process, including installation of the materials provided by LTI 2. The MTC has delegated a team in cooperation with the MOE and LTI 2 to select target schools based on damage assessments. These schools are located in some of the needier areas of Tripoli center, (such as Dahra, Fashloum, and Zaweyat Addahmani), which have higher populations, and have historically suffered from presence of gangs and neglect from government service providers. LTI 2 will also support outreach materials, including a video production to showcase service projects under the “Our Shared Responsibility” campaign. In addition, the MC will hold a meeting at the end of the project gathering principals of schools, the MC members and representatives of MOE to leverage the results of the project toward instituting stronger channels for collaboration in future projects. The MC will coordinate with participants to prepare for the discussion and invite Media outlets to cover the event. This activity will contribute to LTI efforts to increase confidence in the participatory basic service delivery process.

This activity aims to strengthen residents of Tajoura Wasat area's confidence in the MC’s ability to respond to basic service needs in cooperation with relevant national government institutions. Local authorities have struggled to demonstrate responsiveness to community needs, specifically a growing waste problem, due to inadequate resources within both the Tajoura MC and the General Services Company (GSC). The Tajoura Wasat Road is a main thoroughfare, home to approximately half of the area’s residents, and it presents a high-visibility opportunity for authorities to demonstrate improvement in the waste management sector. LTI 2 assistance will enable the Tajoura MC to solve systemic issues hampering waste collection. Specifically, LTI2 will provide equipment to support Tajoura MC’s creation of new waste disposal locations along the Tajoura Wasat Road, thus enabling the MC to simplify public waste disposal and collection processes in collaboration with the GSC. To ensure public knowledge and attribution of the effort, LTI 2 will also support an outreach campaign, including production of promotional and educational materials, as well as a town-hall meeting gathering various stakeholders. This activity will contribute to LTI efforts to increase confidence in the participatory basic service delivery process.

2- Tajoura MC wants to manage waste collection and organize the process in coordination with the related public authorities. 
3-The outreach efforts is an opportunity for Tajoura MC to communicate to its residents. 
4- In absence of strong national government presence, like any other local authority, Tajoura MC wants to provide care and respond to citizens needs and solve their issues. 



",Tajoura Waste Management Project,"
WHY/ISSUE: With unresolved conflicts at the national level, municipal councils (MCs) have assumed significant governance responsibilities since their election in 2014, and they are still viewed as the most credible institutions. According to recent LTI 2-sponsored research, 55% of Libyans view municipal councils as legitimate. Yet, that legitimacy is eroding, as most MCs lack the resources to provide basic services and are detached from both national institutions, other local governance actors, and constituents.

To promote government cohesion, LTI 2 uses local service delivery projects to  facilitate relationships between national ministries and local actors, strengthening the long term institutional channels for the flow of resources and technical capacity to the local level. 
WHO/WHERE: Tajoura is the gateway to Tripoli from the East, and its 230,000 residents are historically divided between Dawn and Dignity allegiances. Tajoura suffers from inadequate and uneven service provision, as compared to other areas of the capital, like Tripoli Center. In Tajoura Wasat, a lack of waste disposal locations mean residents either take long trips to use proper disposal locations, or they dispose of trash in closer unauthorized sites resulting in an accumulation of trash in streets. Tajoura Wasat road is home to approximately 120,000 residents. It begins with the Cardiology Hospital (see TIP037), passes through the underprivileged area of Hamedia, Ben Alsh-har, and ends at the coastal road. This particular location presents a high-visibility opportunity for authorities to demonstrate improvement in the waste management sector to the community.
WITH WHOM: Although an active MC, the Tajoura MC has struggled to provide trash collection services. In addition, the General Services Company (GSC) lacks the financial resources to keep up with collection of overflow waste in unauthorized sites.  The GSC is a national level authority subordinated to the Ministry of Local Governance (MoLG) under the GNA. Tajoura MC aims to improve waste management service delivery by solving systemic issues, that will streamline the GSC waste collections efforts, reducing the number of trips required for them to address waste overflow in unmarked locations, and maximize the GSC’s use of limited time and resources, since they too lack financial resources from the national government. 
HOW/WHAT: In this activity, LTI2 will support Tajoura MC to address a highly visible public problem – waste collection management in Tajoura Wasat Road. LTI2 will support Tajoura MC with the purchase of 10 waste containers; to organize a strong public education campaign; and to facilitate selection of service locations and distribution of waste containers in coordination of the General Service Company. As part of the public education campaign, LTI 2 will support the design and print of outreach materials including signboards and stickers to mark the new, as well as video production to showcase service projects under the “Our Shared Responsibility” campaign. In addition, the MC will hold a town-hall meeting during the project gathering Heads of Local Districts (Mukhtar Mahalla), MC members and community leaders to support MC in its effort and to leverage the results of the project toward instituting stronger channels for collaboration in future projects. The MC will coordinate with the General Service Company to organize the town-hall meeting. This activity will contribute to LTI2 efforts to increase confidence in the participatory basic service delivery process.

This three-day assessment in Tripoli will aim to identify the level of development and functionality of communications infrastructure that can enable Libyans to engage each other in the country’s new democratic space, and allow for local authorities and the international community to engage citizens with key messages and on key issues. The assessment should describe currently available platforms, but also look forward to what new avenues of communication may be on the horizon and what must happen in order for them to become available. Additionally, the assessment should to the extent possible in three days provide a snapshot of ways in which Libyans are currently accessing and using communications media, both to receive information and communicate with others. This is to include SMS, internet/social media, radio, television, print, and word of mouth. To the extent possible without quantitative data collection, the assessment will seek to identify general trends of use by different segments of the population, including women, youth, and others as appropriate. Most importantly, the assessment will seek to identify needs that can possibly be met by the type of small-scale in-kind assistance that OTI can facilitate. Additionally, the consultant should keep an eye out for a Libyan partner organization or individual that is or would be interested in helping OTI to track developments in this sector.

Replicating a successful activity piloted through USAID/OTI's first grant in Libya, this training workshop will raise awareness about human rights by training young members of a fast-growing Libyan human rights organization to identify and protect against rights abuses. At the request of the local organization, Human Rights Solidarity, this USAID/OTI grant funded materials and workspace for a five-day training workshop covering the history and evolution of human rights principles, pertinent international laws, protection strategies, and the role of civil society in human rights monitoring and advocacy. Two technical experts from the Geneva Institute for Human Rights (GIHR) implemented the workshop in Tripoli. Human Rights Solidarity, through it's newly opened branch in the capital, arranged for the participation of 25 rising young civil-society activists who have demonstrated a commitment to fostering human rights awareness and protection in a democratic Libya. The Tripoli workshop was preceded by a separate five-day workshop, also held by the GIHR trainers, in Benghazi (and funded through a separate OTI implementing partner).

",Bringing Human Rights Training from East to West,"
Human Rights Solidarity, a non-governmental organization directed at publicizing human rights abuses in Libya, was founded in Switzerland in 1999 by Dr. Ahmed Ghweidi, a Libyan medical doctor and activist.  Following the 17 February uprising in Benghazi, Human Rights Solidarity returned its headquarters to Libya.

The group has been active in hosting, supporting, and participating in dozens of human-rights events in Benghazi since the ousting of Qadhafi’s government from the city. From 8-14 September, 2011, the organization hosted an OTI-funded human rights training event in Benghazi that was highly successful (BENDAI001). During this course, young participants from a wide range of civil society and media organizations were introduced to basic human rights principles, critical components of international human rights law, human rights monitoring techniques, protection methods, and advocacy strategies. By way of this program and others, Human Rights Solidarity has established a leadership role vis-à-vis similarly motivated organization that have more recently constituted themselves in eastern Libya.  

Trainers for the event held in September were recruited from the Helsinki Foundation in Warsaw, Poland, and were strictly English-speaking. Participation was therefore limited to only those young activists with a high degree of proficiency in English. After-action reports from that event included recommendations that a similar courses be held in Arabic for a wider cross-section of the population. Since hosting its first grant under OTI’s Regional Option (BENDAI001), Human Rights Solidarity has also gained a strong operational foothold in the capital. The current grant, therefore, will aim to deliver a five-day training in Tripoli after the first one (under BENDAI006) in Benghazi.  

For training services DAI, in close consultation with OTI and with Libyan Human Rights Solidarity, proposes to retain the services of expert trainers from the Geneva Institute for Human Rights. The Geneva Institute has deep experience implementing programs similar to the one proposed, including training experience with Libyan organizations. The Center has a long record of success working with the international offices of Libyan Human Rights Solidarity, and has contributed substantially to the development of the proposed curriculum. The Institute can provide native Arabic-speaking trainers, and has the capacity to deploy immediately to Benghazi.

Because the program will take place in both Benghazi and Tripoli, implementation support for activities will be divided among OTI’s two implementing partners in Libya – DAI and Chemonics. Each implementing partner will enter into its own grant agreement with the respective offices of Human Rights Solidarity in the two cities. DAI’s role under its own grant will be to secure all technical services provided by the Geneva Institute, including the salaries, transportation costs (international and domestic), and materials costs associated with trainings in both Benghazi and Tripoli. DAI’s grant activities will also include all facilitation requirements on the ground in Benghazi. For the Tripoli component, Chemonics will sponsor through this grant accommodation of local facilitation requirements on the ground in Tripoli.

The trainings themselves will comprise two five-day events that will address: 

1. Basic human rights principles – their history, evolution, and institutional significance.
2. International human rights law – conventions, treaties, and protections.
3. Protection strategies – relevant institutions, conventions, and mechanisms.
4. The role of civil society in human rights monitoring and advocacy.

In addition to the training of its own members, Libya Human Rights Solidarity will invite the participation of other leading human-rights advocates from civil society and the press.

",After the Revolution: Positive Messaging on the Transition and Ways Forward,"
On October 23, the liberation of Libya was announced in Benghazi. In August 2011, the Transitional National Council (TNC) released the Constitutional Charter for the Transitional Stage and this document outlines the road map for this period. More specifically, Article 30 outlines and defines this way forward. A post-revolutionary Libya will be defined by complex social, political, and economic issues as the country moves towards the establishment of democratic governance. More fundamentally, democracy and transition are new terms in Libya and many Libyans do not understand the fundamentals of the transition period.

Youth played a pivotal role in the revolution and define a majority of the population in Libya. The median age of the country is approximately 24.5 years of age. Youth have become growingly frustrated with the new leadership for ignoring their input, dismissing their passion and taking for granted their support. In Tripoli, as elsewhere, Libyan youth have demonstrated a sophisticated level of interest in how the transition occurs and what the end results will be. Considering that youth constitute a formidable percentage of the population, there are many windows of opportunity for their empowerment and positive participation in this process. 

One such young group, H20, has identified that raising awareness around the TNC’s road map and generating an overall dialogue through information dissemination and outreach are needed in order for youth to engage in a more constructive dialogue on the next steps forward in the country. H20 is based in Tripoli and was founded by ten young individuals concerned about the transition process in their country and are supporting the positive contribution that youth can make during this process and the overall support that youth can provide in the development of an emerging democracy. They currently have a membership of 55 that is expanding with temporary office space in the capital. 

This activity aims to develop simplified information materials around the various steps over the next 20 months outlined in the roadmap and support an outreach campaign in Tripoli specifically targeting youth. H20 will also model the change they would like to see in the country by engaging with the members of the organization (10 founding members and 55 others) in a participatory process to discuss the preliminary designs for the information materials and campaigns, solicits inputs and recommendations from members, come to a consensus and revise the materials moving forward. The preliminary design illustrates a building that has 10 stories built on the foundation of the revolution and highlight critical milestones in the road map. 

This activity assumes that by engaging youth and increasing their awareness on the country’s transition to a new government, they will be able to advance public expression and debate about the democratic transition.

",Engaging Through Dialogue: Constitution Making in Libya After Liberation,"
Constitution-making processes, particularly in post-conflict and transitional states, can be uniquely important moments of national reflection, discussion, and self-determination over the nature of the newly transformed nation and state. If handled correctly, such processes can not only increase the legitimacy of the constitution itself, but also galvanize the nation by helping fractured and disparate peoples reach consensus over key issues of governance; develop, strengthen and promote national identity; provide a framework for negotiation and reconciliation among political forces and other communities of interest; educate citizens on the principles and practice of democracy through civic education and participation in the constitution-making process; demonstrate a commitment by political leadership or government to democratic principles and processes; and address regional or ethnic issues through new institutional arrangements, rights or guarantees. 

Poorly constructed and implemented constitution-making processes, however, can create or exacerbate fissures in society, particularly if groups feel marginalized or excluded, risking the new national project fails even before it truly begins. How the constitution-making process proceeds, therefore, is often as or more important than the final document itself.

Recent examples from Africa and around the world provide insight into options for designing and implementing constitution-making processes that can enjoy many of the positive consequences described above and are more likely lead to a constitution that enjoys widespread legitimacy. Five core principles lay at the heart of such a process:  inclusivity, participation, transparency, consensus-driven decision-making, and national ownership. A dialogue with grantee??? supported by USIP can help national actors better appreciate the importance of incorporating these principles into the design of their constitution-making process and provide specific options for how to apply them in practice to suit their specific circumstances and needs.

This activity aims to organize and facilitate a 3-day dialogue with representatives of Libyan government, political movements and civil society on goals, principles, and options for constitutional reform. The dialogue would focus on facilitating discussion between the three sectors about the future of the Libyan state. 

The agenda would be organized around the following sessions and questions:

* What is a Constitution and how does a Constitution impact the country and people’s daily lives?  What is constitution-making?  How does it happen?  What are the goals of a constitution-making process?  And why is the process itself important?
* What are the core principles of constitution-making?  Why are they important?  And how do they help to achieve the constitution-making goals?
* How can the core principles be applied most effectively in Libya?
* What are the different constitution-making options:  institutions, phases, mandates, etc.?  And what are the appropriate roles of government, political parties and civil society in constitution-making, and options for each?
* How can each sector engage in awareness raising, education, advocacy for a constitution-making process that adheres to the core principles and strives to achieve a legitimate and galvanizing constitution?  What can each sector do in the short, medium, and longer term to achieve these goals?

Particular emphasis could be placed on the exchange of ideas, both existing challenges and future priorities and goals, among the three sectors and how each can engage in their nation’s constitutional moment. Through lectures, plenary discussions, and working groups the participants would discover and explore the core principles and their possible applications with an eye towards direct application towards their unique circumstances.  The discussion would be entirely driven by the participants’ agendas, priorities, needs and concerns; however, views would be informed by (a) international experience; and (b) exchange of views between different sectors, including government, civil society, women, youth, etc.

The dialogue will target 40 participants with representation from the above-mentioned sectors. This would not only create a more inclusive and representative dialogue, but allow each to learn about current thinking, priorities, and agenda of the others as they individually and collectively begin to formulate their own agenda and priorities to advocate for after the dialogue.

The outcomes from the dialogue may include any/all of the following: participants’ increased knowledge and awareness about best practices in constitution-making; better informed and more empowered civil society (who might otherwise be excluded from the discussion); concrete steps each sector might take to raise awareness, educate, and advocate for a constitution-making process that adheres to the core principles; exchange of ideas between the civil society, government officials and political party representatives; better insight on the part of the international community about existing and likely challenges to a future constitution-making process and how the international community might provide constitutional assistance going forward.

",Rapid Assessment of the Media Landscape in Libya,"
Media plays a key role in the development of a democratic Libya. Upcoming education and information outreach campaigns will be particularly important for the success of Libyan parliamentary and presidential elections that are planned for mid-2012. This campaign will rely in part on an effective education of the population, a process in which independent, rights-based mass media and Libyan NGOs will play an important role. A  rapid  assessment  of  the  Libyan  media  landscape will  be  a  necessary  first  step  to  ensuring subsequent work in either the media sector or education campaigns is effectively targeted. USAID/OTI has the opportunity to bolster Libya’s transition by supporting, among other initiatives; the development of a focused, durable and capable Libyan civil society the development of an independent, rights-based media and public education campaigns regarding human and civil rights and responsibilities.

This activity aims to implement a rapid assessment of the media landscape and consumption habits in five major cities of Libya, as well as ongoing public information campaigns; provide recommendations for the most effective channels for rolling out public education campaigns on human and civil rights and responsibilities. Additionally, this activity will support the following: 

* Identify  (and  monitor  developments  in)  the  public  and  private  media  institutions,  at  a  national  and municipal level.
*  Identify major developments in the regulatory or legislative environments that could disrupt the media landscape in the shorter and medium term.
*  Identify  auxiliary  public  and  private  media  organizations,  including  news  agencies,  media  production centers, and media training centers.
*  Identify the major Libya-focused public and private media channels, including: printed media (daily and weekly newspapers and magazines), radio, terrestrial and satellite television.
*  For the top five most popular channels in each media category, identify the typical content, distribution volume/access, audience segment, frequencies (where relevant), approximate popularity, ownership, gateway, political affiliation, longevity, financing model and accessibility to use the channel for education campaign.
*  For top five most popular channels in each media category, identify the geographical coverage at an urban district level, to identify which urban areas have an abundance, deficit or bias in media channels.
*  Understand qualitatively levels of internet access in each district, and current trends in internet use (e.g., popular websites and internet voting campaigns) and in the development of social media.
*  Identify  ongoing public  information  campaigns and current lines of communication  of  the  transitional regime.
*  Recommend   the   most   effective   channels   for   rolling   out   public   education/awareness   campaigns, differentiating where possible between the different education campaigns, and different societal segments including a) youth with no higher education, b) youth with higher-education, c) blue collar, d) white collar, the e) elderly, f) internally displaced peoples/vulnerable communities (e.g., Tawergha, African or Abu Salim communities, etc.), males and female.

Since the uprising in February 2011, and the liberation of the country, there has been an explosion of new and independent media. A significant characteristic of all the newly emerged media personnel is that the majority of do not have a media or communications background and need to develop a better understanding of independent media and the role it plays in an open society.

",Liberating Media in Tripoli: Improving Media Content and Training Journalists,"
During the reign of Muammar Qadhafi, Libya was rated as one of the least free countries in the Arab region – especially in terms of freedom of expression and open media. Since the uprising in February 2011, and the liberation of the country, there has been an explosion of new and independent media. As of July 2011, about 120 publications, five radio stations and three-to-five TV stations are now on the street and in the air, according to the Media Communication Committee (MCC) - the media arm of the National Transitional Council.

A significant characteristic of all the newly emerged media personnel is that the majority fo not have a media or communications background – they are students of other professions (engineers, doctors, dentists, students etc.). Many left their jobs or course of study when the revolution began – and most do expect to go back one day. However, they have identified a need in their communities for free and accurate information and they are proactively making it happen. Thus, very few of them have a clear picture of their future in media and a majority of those who are currently reporting may not continue to do so when stable conditions are re-established in Libya. Thus, it is safe to assume that there will be a considerable decline in the number of media outlets since the revolution is near over. 

Amongst the challenges facing new and upcoming media in Libya is clearly the lack of professional journalistic skills, the lack of funding and the lack of knowledge of concrete business models, which will keep new media outlets afloat in the long term. Some media actors during Internews’ assessments also highlighted the lack of an independent printing facility as a challenge as well as a fear of the old mentality and regime manifesting itself in media.

The Libya uprising began February 2011, with many saying protests in Benghazi were initially sparked by the arrest of prominent lawyer and human rights activist, Fathi Terbil, on February 15th. Things quickly escalated and calls for a large-scale ‘Day of Rage’ on February 17th circulated via online social media networks.  Protests took place in the eastern city of Benghazi, as well as other eastern towns, and to a more limited extent in the West, where security measures were much tighter. Reports followed of government crackdowns and increasing resistance response, including the defection of several local army personnel. Protests and security reprisals were also reported in the country’s capital, Tripoli. By February 20th, Human Rights Watch estimated 233 people had been killed, a number which quickly rose.  

Communications to the east, with infrastructure centralized in Tripoli, were cut, including internet, landline, and mobile phones. Misrata, in the west, also became similarly isolated. International journalists were harassed by the regime and its supporters, a number of them arrested; by late May five journalists were confirmed killed in the conflict. The rebels centered in Benghazi established the NTC, which first met on March 5th. This was initially set up not explicitly as an interim government, but explicitly to ‘provide an international face for the uprising;’ that aimed to oversee a transition to liberal democracy. 

On March 29th, the NTC issued a ‘Vision Statement’, which served as a general ‘road-map’ for the establishment of a liberal democracy in the country. The use of the internet wasn’t the only major media factor; over the past decade, satellite TV has become increasingly prominent, with the rise of news stations like Al Jazeera, who have especially made an enormous change in media. In fact, watching the coverage in neighboring uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia on these channels was commonly cited as having had a galvanizing effect on protestors in Libya.

Media in Tripoli has made extraordinary, however tenuous, gains in a very limited period of time. Many interlocutors have spoken of the need to increase capacity with training and institutional assistance, whether through workshops and classes, mentorships, assistance in institutional development, or via relationships with broadcast and journalism institutions internationally. Limitations in media capacity take many forms. At the simplest level, Qadhafi’s regime seriously restricted the chances for journalists, editors, and students to develop critical and even practical skills. While senior or experienced former media workers do have significant talent, a number stated the need for further support and training, and the great majority of young journalists have received little, to no training at all.

This activity will be implemented by Internews. Internews is a globally recognized leader in the implementation of media development and development public communications activities in post-conflict and security challenged environments. 

The media outlets that the Internews assessment team spoke with in May and June 2011 (more specifically focused in the east and not in Tripoli) all identified themselves as ‘supporting the revolution’. They defined their roles as explicitly countering Qadhafi regime propaganda, urging former Qadhafi supporters to join the revolution, recognizing and honoring those killed in the fighting and their families and motivating the public to continue to support the revolution. However in their avowed support of the revolution, the line between independent reporting and promoting the revolution is often blurred. 

It is apparent that emerging media outlets lack the proper training, professionalism and grounding in media ethics. Internews envisions helping develop a better understanding of independent media and the role it plays in an open society. In order to support the local media’s mission to inform the outside world about events in Libya and educating Libyans about political transitions and processes, Internews has compiled the urgent needs of local media outlets in Libya. These include:

1. 	A need for media to become more professional: basic journalistic skills, awareness of journalistic standards and ethics, and financially sustainable business model
2.	 Build an institutional framework for future trainings and a strategic move to professional journalism of the media which also ensures local ownership
3.	 Need for equipment and technical support for outlets
4.	 Need for support to the new independent media and media activists to organize themselves, and build frameworks for future co-operation. 

The rapidly evolving situation on the ground, along with the transitory nature of current regulatory and political structures requires interventions to be designed to be flexible and responsive.  This means media support needs to be targeted and meeting current needs but without becoming locked into a limited number of relationships or assuming events will take one particular course. Activities must aim to meet several immediate and short-term goals, but also to facilitate broad relationships and input that allow Libyan media practitioners to engage in their own debates and set their own future directions.

As the situation in Tripoli from a media perspective resembles Benghazi from the above-mentioned needs, the context is very different with Tripoli only have been liberated since September however the a larger share of state media assets located in the capital and a much larger urban and ""cosmopolitan"" population. Additionally, media practitioners have only recently emerged and have not seen the level of support as say Benghazi which was liberated much earlier on in the revolution. Therefore, and also due to Internews' previous assessment in the east and only recent exposure to Tripoli, this activity will specifically focus on support in Tripoli. This activity aims to conduct an assessment and baseline content analysis in Phase 1 and based upon Phase 1 recommendations provide training and on-site mentoring to media partners in Tripoli to improve the quality of available content. This improvement in content is key during the transition period in the country in the lead-up to elections and the writing of a constitution.

With newly found political space for dialogue and debate on a variety of issues around the transition and emerging democracy, many requests have emerged for technical assistance support to workshops and conferences that often utilize expertise outside of Libya. In some cases, appropriate experts do not have Arabic speaking skills nor do participants have English (or other) speaking skills and thus translation becomes key. As simultaneous translation equipment is quite difficult to find in-country, and rental is rather expensive, this activity aims to support the procurement and delivery of two sets of translation equipment for approximately 30 individuals which will be used for simultaneous translation activities at LTI supported workshops and conferences. Additionally, the project may consider loaning this equipment to other donors and/or organizations for use at non-LTI related events.

",Getting on the Same Page: Simultaneous Translation Equipment,"
With a newly freed Libya comes a newly freed Libyan media and civil society and the political space for different voices and open dialogue on ways forward for the country. In the wake of the revolution, civil society, citizens and media in Libya will play an integral role in stabilizing the country, but after decades of the brutal and suppressive dictatorship of the Gaddafi regime, the overall situation is precarious, building on an extremely thin base, and lack of understanding on the fundamentals of emerging issues in the transition.  

With this newly found space, many requests have emerged for technical assistance support to workshops and conferences that often utilize expertise outside of Libya. In some cases, appropriate experts do not have Arabic speaking skills and thus translation becomes key in these workshops and conferences. Additionally, many participants only speak Arabic. Therefore, a gap exists that needs to be filled by translation and necessary equipment.  

During the development of TRIP005 - Engaging Through Dialogue: Constitution Making in Libya After Liberation, LTI found that simultaneous translation equipment is quite difficult to find in-country, and rental is rather expensive. As the project envisions a variety of conferences and workshops over the project period, the team determined that purchasing rather than renting equipment made sense and could be utilized for a variety of events and venues. Additionally to ensure that these events are not just plenary in nature, but that working groups are key for more profound dialogue between participants. 

This activity aims to support the procurement and delivery of two sets of translation equipment including at least 15 receiving headsets and one headset with microphone per set which will be used for simultaneous translation activities at LTI supported workshops and conferences. Additionally the project may consider loaning this equipment to other donors and/or organizations for use at non-LTI related events.

Based upon the quotation process, the rental cost of the equipment from TRIP005 was 5400 LYD for three days (for 60 persons) which at an exchange rate of 1.3 dinars = $4,153.84. Assuming that the two sets are used 10 times, from a rental perspective this would equal $20,769.23. As the equipment will cost approximately $8,760, this equates to an approximate cost savings of $12,009.23 over the course of a year.

","Support to the Price of Freedom Campaign - Reconciliation, Unity and Forgiveness","
As Libya moves forward after the revolution and recently declared liberation, the country begins its process of recovering from not only the brutal, authoritarian rule of the Qadhafi regime but also from a war in which has left many social and psychological scars. Tensions and outright conflict continues to affect several areas of the country such as Taourga/Misrata, Zintan/Mshasheya, Gheryan/Asabaa, and Zawia/Wershefana. 

As Libyans are very optimistic about their future, these remaining points of fissure and vulnerability in the transition have illustrated the sensitivity of the current context and the need to support the process of a peace transition. In order to capitalize on the positive sentiments of the population in such a sensitive stage, a local women’s group, Phoenix Libya and based in Tripoli, is currently working on promoting on large-scale awareness campaign titled “Price of Freedom”. This campaign aims to raise awareness about major social/cultural issues that stand in the face of a peaceful transition to a stable democratic country. The campaign will be divided into five main topics/issues, and all topics will be linked to the same main idea which is “The price we paid for our freedom was very high … Do not let it go, to waste by …….” The five themes to be covered include the following:

* Reconciliation, Unity, and Forgiveness
* Women’s Rights
* Political Prisoners 
* Disabled War Veterans 
* Keep Your City Clean

This activity will help to support their outreach and awareness raising campaign for one of the first topics of Phoenix Libya’s campaign and will specifically supports Reconciliation, Unity, and Forgiveness. 

All campaign material will emphasize the importance of accepting differences, letting go of the past,  and focus on motivating Libyans to start working and building their country together. The characters featured in the campaign materials have been carefully selected to represent all sections of the Libyan population (Gender, Race, Age, Ideology, etc.) and will be promoted through different media outlets including TV, Radio, Billboards, Flyers, Internet. The main content being developed is around people, representative of people from all parts of Libyan society, saying one word to complete a sentence focusing on this message for radio and TV, with the sentence and photo of people for the billboard, etc. 

Phoenix Libya has impressively been able to leverage resources by obtain free of cost or discounted rates for the production of TV PSAs (only a portion is being requested), radio breaks, an internet campaign, billboards, flyers and brochures. They have also received free of discounted rates on the printing/broadcasting of TV PSAs (only a portion is being requested), radio, internet publicity, billboards (only a portion is being requested), flyers and brochures (only a portion is being requested). At the writing of this activity, it was not possible to ascertain the cost share but LTI staff will work with the grantee to ascertain this amount at the closing of the grant. 

This activity assumes that by widely disseminating information on major social/cultural issues that are challenging the country while emphasizing unity and that Libyans maintain positive momentum together will encourage dialogue in the country on issues in the transition.

",Video Competition: Freedom of Expression & Positive Messaging on the Transition,"
With the liberation of Libya there has been a proliferation of media outlets spurred on by 42 years on oppressive limitations on freedom of speech and expression. Media and informal information networks played a key role in the mobilization of resources and support for the ideals of the revolution. Under Qadhafi, media was utilized as a way of legitimizing and upholding Libyan institutions controlled by the head of state. 

Civil society is also a new development in post-revolutionary Libya and as such has similar issues to those of the media, in terms of under-developed communications and messaging mechanisms and skills. As such, there is a need for the connection to be made between media and civil society in order to ensure that NGOs are both training in effective messaging and outreach, and have access to outlets for disseminating opinions and messages that come out of their programming. 

The Freedom Center for Media and Cultural Excellence is a Libyan NGO formed post-revolution which aims to contribute to ongoing efforts in transition through facilitating the development of an independent media and communication services provider. During the revolution media centers were developed in Misrata and Benghazi, although the Benghazi Center is far more established. There has also been a civil society center established in Benghazi with the support of OTI. The Center in Tripoli aims at combining these initiatives for a comprehensive approach to engaging civil society and media in the creation of space, and the development of media content and a credible media to enhance the debate and dialogue around key issues. 

The Center will work initially with two external experts to develop their capacity in their chosen activities. Through its board members the Center has developed linkages with the Tripoli Local Council and other media outlets and journalists. It will be important to ensure that linkages are created at the national level with other media centers throughout the country for the exchange of ideas, messaging and lessons learned. The Center supports four broad columns of development; NGO media and communications support; Media and communication support to Tripoli Local Council; Support to the local media of Libya; and Culture in Libya Society. Support is also being provided under TRIP012 and TRIP013 for the establishment of the center. 

This activity will support an open video competition to promote awareness raising on issues relevant to the ongoing transition while also promoting the center. The criteria for applying for the video competition is that the video must fall under one of the following categories:

*  Democracy
*  Civic education
*  Elections
*  Economic (economic development)
*  Disarming (removal of weapons) 
*  Interests ( مصالح )

The video should not be longer than 3 mins, the closing date for the submission of this video is 29th Feb 2012

It is assumed that by engaging in the Media Center in Tripoli there will be increased engagement of citizens, civil society and other actors in the dialogue and debate around key issues related to the transition. This in itself will increase the opportunities for the Libyan population to ensure their voices are heard in the lead up to the development of the constitution and elections.

Expectations are at very high levels and people are frustrated with not having information as to what the next steps are. With awareness so low at a key juncture, this grant will increase local participation in political decision making by supporting awareness raising about the transition to democracy in Libya. This activity aims to organize and facilitate a two day workshop with 45 representatives of Libyan NGOs on goals, explaining the principles and definitions of constitution making in Tripoli, Sabha and Surman. This activity assumes that by increasing the awareness of different NGOs from different localities on the principles of democracy and constitution processes that they will be able to positively engage in debates and dialogues on the transition and more specifically on the constitution making process.

",Bringing Civil Society Together: Workshop on the Constitution,"
After the announcement of the liberation of all Libya, many local NGOs began working on raising civic and cultural awareness about the upcoming election and constitution writing process as the country moves towards the building of a democracy. There is a fundamental lack of awareness and understanding on the basic principles of democracy including elections and constitution-making which are major hurdles in the short-term. However, Libyans are incredibly positive towards the ongoing transitional phase and are requesting more information, transparency and involvement in the ongoing transition process in the country. 

Alalam and Surman Alhurra have a common potential about how to help and develop the civil society. Both of the organizations share the same idea, to generate an overall dialogue through information dissemination and an outreach campaign in order for segments of Libyans to engage in a more constructive dialogue on the next steps forward the country. 

This activity aims to develop simplified materials and information around the basic principles of democracy and constitution making. The materials that will be utilized and presented in this workshop are the same as those utilized inTRIP005 “Engaging Through Dialogue: Constitution-Making in Libya After Liberation” that was held in November 2011.  This workshop targeted high-level NTC officials, well-known lawyers and high level civil society groups. This activity will utilize the same materials and bring this information to a more grassroots/local level.  

Moreover, a variety of the geographical locations will be represented during the workshop as Surrman Alhurra works in the western part of the country in the district of Az Zawiyah while Alalam works in Sabha located in the south. The partner will also invite representatives from Tripoli based NGOs. This approach during the workshop and identification of participants will help facilitate networking and linkages between different NGOs and engage grassroots in the coming electoral and constitution making process.

With the liberation of Libya there has been a proliferation of media outlets spurred on by 42 years on oppressive limitations on freedom of speech and expression. Media and informal information networks played a key role in the mobilization of resources and support for the ideals of the revolution. Under Qadhafi, media was utilized as a way of legitimizing and upholding Libyan institutions controlled by the head of state. 

In the wake of the revolution, the media in Libya developed in an ad hoc and organic way during the revolution promoting human rights and democracy in part to counter the regime’s propaganda. Within this context the objectivity of media and an understanding of ethics remain under-developed. Journalists and media outlets have limited capacity, training and skills on which to draw to ensure that messaging and engagement with relevant actors is done in ways that are objective, directed and contributing to the creation of space and dialogue around key issues and concerns in this period. Generally speaking the Libyan population wants to be engaged in dialogue and there is a need to ensure that the revolutionary rhetoric is positively captured and transformed into a rights-based framework for development, which encompasses public debate and opinion.

Civil society is also a new development in post-revolutionary Libya and as such has similar issues to those of the media, in terms of under-developed communications and messaging mechanisms and skills. As such, there is a need for the connection to be made between media and civil society in order to ensure that NGOs are both training in effective messaging and outreach, and have access to outlets for disseminating opinions and messages that come out of their programming. Civil society potentially has a wide source of information through their programming throughout the country, and provides the media with additional sources of messaging if they are engaged and understand the basic concepts of how to ensure information is shared and disseminated. The media and civil society together can learn from each other and contribute to voter and civic education in the context Libya if captured and enhanced through such forums as the Freedom Center for Media and Cultural Excellence. 

The Freedom Center for Media and Cultural Excellence is a Libyan NGO formed post-revolution which aims to contribute to ongoing efforts in transition through facilitating the development of an independent media and communication services provider. During the revolution media centers were developed in Misrata and Benghazi, although the Benghazi Center is far more established.

This activity will support the opening and institutionalization of the Center through the provision of expertise on strategic communication, staffing and the refurbishment of bathrooms. It aims at creating the space for increased dialogue and debate between NGOs and media and the inclusion of the public in key issues related to the transition. It is assumed that through providing support to the local media including increased training on issues of objectivity and messaging there will be a forum through which the voice of the public can be captured and heard by key decision makers and stakeholders in the interim authorities. Providing space in which individuals and civil society can approach the media to express their opinion, will provide an important piece in the process of dialogue and civic education. 

It is assumed that by engaging in the Media Center in Tripoli there will be increased engagement of civil society and other actors in the dialogue and debate around key issues related to the transition. It is also thought that by increasing the capacity of civil society to engage and utilize media in a productive, targeted way. This will help them to leverage and connect with the government through public dialogue and debate on key issues. This in itself will increase the opportunities for the Libyan population to ensure their voices are heard in the lead up to the development of the constitution and elections. It is also assumed that in operationalizing and developing the capacity of the center there will develop a new platform for dissemination and outreach in the engagement in dialogue.

Media and informal information networks played a key role in the mobilization of resources and support for the ideals of the revolution. Under Qadhafi, media was utilized as a way of legitimizing and upholding Libyan institutions controlled by the head of state. 

In the wake of the revolution, the media in Libya developed in an ad hoc and organic way during the revolution promoting human rights and democracy in part to counter the regime’s propaganda. Within this context the objectivity of media and an understanding of ethics remain under-developed. Journalists and media outlets have limited capacity, training and skills on which to draw to ensure that messaging and engagement with relevant actors is done in ways that are objective, directed and contributing to the creation of space and dialogue around key issues and concerns in this period. Generally speaking the Libyan population wants to be engaged in dialogue and there is a need to ensure that the revolutionary rhetoric is positively captured and transformed into a rights-based framework for development, which encompasses public debate and opinion.

Civil society is also a new development in post-revolutionary Libya and as such has similar issues to those of the media, in terms of under-developed communications and messaging mechanisms and skills. As such, there is a need for the connection to be made between media and civil society in order to ensure that NGOs are both training in effective messaging and outreach, and have access to outlets for disseminating opinions and messages that come out of their programming. Civil society potentially has a wide source of information through their programming throughout the country, and provides the media with additional sources of messaging if they are engaged and understand the basic concepts of how to ensure information is shared and disseminated. The media and civil society together can learn from each other and contribute to voter and civic education in the context Libya if captured and enhanced through such forums as the Freedom Center for Media and Cultural Excellence. 

The Freedom Center for Media and Cultural Excellence is a Libyan NGO formed post-revolution which aims to contribute to ongoing efforts in transition through facilitating the development of an independent media and communication services provider. During the revolution media centers were developed in Misrata and Benghazi, although the Benghazi Center is far more established. There has also been a civil society center established in Benghazi with the support of OTI. The center in Tripoli aims at combining these initiatives for a comprehensive approach to engaging civil society and media in the creation of space, and the development of media content and a credible media to enhance the debate and dialogue around key issues. The Center will work initially with two external experts to develop their capacity in their chosen activities. Through its board members the Center has developed linkages with the Tripoli Local Council and other media outlets and journalists. It will be important to ensure that linkages are created at the national level with other media centers throughout the country for the exchange of ideas, messaging and lessons learned. The Center supports four broad columns of development; NGO media and communications support; Media and communication support to Tripoli Local Council; Support to the local media of Libya; and Culture in Libya Society.

This activity will support the provision of equipment for the center in Tripoli aiming at development of quality content of media and its credibility. Through the provision of equipment it is assumed that members of both media outlets and civil society organizations will be encouraged to engage and have the resources available to them to be trained in effective communications which both serve their beneficiaries and capture their opinions, ideas and feedback into a broader discussion and dialogue on key issues. The training provided through the center, which will be equipped, will enable NGOs and media to improve the content of their messaging and filter into media messaging and strategic communications.

It is assumed that by engaging in the Media Center in Tripoli there will be increased engagement of civil society and other actors in the dialogue and debate around key issues related to the transition. It is also thought that by increasing the capacity of civil society to engage and utilize media in a productive, targeted way. This will help them to leverage and connect with the government through public dialogue and debate on key issues. This in itself will increase the opportunities for the Libyan population to ensure their voices are heard in the lead up to the development of the constitution and elections. It is also assumed that in operationalizing and developing the capacity of the center there will develop a new platform for dissemination and outreach in the engagement in dialogue.

Evident from the early days of the 17 February Revolution, the end of 42 years of oppressive limitations on freedom of speech and expression has led to a proliferation of music and other creative forms of popular expression by all sectors of Libyan society. With a particular focus on Libyan youth, this activity will both improve the quality of information and expand the means by which the public receives its information about the transition to democracy. The grant will fund semi-professional audio/visual equipment and production time for a hip-hop group whose lyrics discuss the positive changes and electoral processes that lie ahead after the end of the Qaddafi regime. The support will help the group, Good Against Bad, produce five music videos and ten songs with key transition-related messages. Based in Tripoli, Good Against Bad has become familiar to many Libyans since it first began producing pro-revolution music last summer, and has established a high level of “street credibility” among Tripolitan youth.

",Straight Outta Libya: Transition Messaging through Hip-Hop,"
With the liberation of Libya there has been a proliferation of music and popular expression spurred on by 42 years of oppressive limitations on freedom of speech and expression. Media and informal revolutionary music played a key role in informing the public and mobilizing public opinion to support for the ideals of the revolution. Under Gaddafi, media and any musical expression was utilized as a way of legitimizing and upholding Libyan institutions controlled by the head of state. 

In this context, the liberalization of the expression in Libya has developed in ad hoc and organic way during the revolution, in order to promote values of human rights and democracy in order to counter the regime’s accusations and propaganda. During the revolution CDs of music in Tamazight, Arabic and English were produced as young musicians and artists used this to express their ideas and opinions against the regime and allowed people to reconnect with their repressed cultural identities. Youth led music groups have since developed this as a way of educating others utilizing popular forms of music genres such as hip-hop. 

Good Against Bad has been producing songs and making videos in their garage post-revolution, they do so using basic equipment and donating their time for free. They are keen to spread awareness of various issues that come out of popular thinking and ideology, wanting to help the younger generation to expand their thinking and motivating them to extend their boundaries in support of development and engagement. They are looking to develop their lyrics in support of democratic values, the constitution, human rights, education, the elections and other poignant subjects.  

This activity will support the provision of semi-professional audio-visual equipment to Good Against Bad in order for them to produce higher quality sound and video products that could be utilized more widely in engaging especially younger generations. It will also provide technical support and assistance for them to produce 5 videos and 10 songs over a seven month period. These will aim at providing another mechanism for spreading key messages on the transition in the run up to the election and constitution making process. 

Some proposed subject for songs includes but is not limited to the following:

*Democracy
* Constitution
* Human and civilian rights
* Education
* Banning weapons and military features/icons from the image of the country
* Elections 

It is assumed that through developing the capacity of Good Against Bad they can form part of the civic education that needs to happen in the lead up to the elections. They have the potential to be linked into to other LTI grants such as the constitutional awareness program by H2O (supported under TRIP003) and the Freedom Center in Tripoli (supported under TRIP010, TRIP012, and TRIP013). Music and hip-hop are popular forms of expression that are often spread fast through web-based media, and can have wide spread ramifications if channeled into the right outlets. There is also the opportunity for outreach programs such as those of H2O to link into Good Against Bad and engage youth population in having their voices heard.

This activity aims to dissiminate simplified information and vocabulary on the constitution and election process in the Libyan dialect through a campaign that will produce and distribute nine separate flyers on democracy related vocabulary (6,000 copies of each flyer) in Tripoli and three two-minute video episodes on elections processes which will be posted on the web and aired on television nationwide as many Libyans do not understand the basic vocabulary on the fundamentals of democracy, constitution making and elections. This lack of understanding inhibits an effective and productive dialogue on issues that are currently ongoing in the country and constrains the population especially youth and civil societies’ contributions and their ability to effectively participate in the process. This activity assumes that a more educated public, especially youth, will be positively engaged in the political process and will be able to more productively engage and debate the democratic transition.

",Basic Democracy Fundamentals and Voter Education Outreach in Tripoli,"
Since the liberation of the country in August 2011, severe tensions have occurred during the transition process. Youth have played a pivotal role in the revolution and country’s liberation and define a majority of the population in Libya. Youth have become growingly frustrated with the new leadership for ignoring their input, dismissing their passion, and taking for granted their support. In Tripoli, as elsewhere, Libyan youth have demonstrated a sophisticated level of interest in how the transition occurs and what the end results will be. Considering that youth constitute a formidable percentage of the population, there are many windows of opportunity for their empowerment and positive participation in this process.

Many Libyans do not understand the basic vocabulary on the fundamentals of democracy, constitution making and elections. This lack of understanding inhibits effective and productive dialogue on transitional issues that are currently ongoing in the country. Also by not understanding these issues, the population especially youth and civil society are constrained in their contributions and their ability to effectively participate in the process is weakened.  

One such Tripoli based youth group, Alleqaa, has already been engaged in civic education around the transition process and on human rights. They have identified that fundamentally, democracy and transition are new terms in Libya and many Libyans do not grasp the basic knowledge and comprehensive of this terminology and what the implications and impacts are on the transition and on the future trajectory of the country as it moves towards democracy.  

This activity aims to dissimilate simplified information about the terminology of the constitution and election process. Alleqaa will create and implement a campaign about the principles of constitution and election through six separate flyers with 6,000 copies of each flyer and three two-minute video episodes in Tripoli and across Libya. 

The flyers will utilize basic vocabulary terms about the constitution and election in simplified Arabic language more specifically with a Libyan dialect. The videos will use cartoon animation and the image of a box called Bakoo. The main reason that a cartoon will be utilized as that it will distinguish the campaign and be more neutral in that the character will not be individual Libyans and it is felt will provide a more neutral figure for the dissemination of information that is less prone to criticism. The Bakoo character will represent the election box and in each episode it will provide information and discuss certain problems related to election process. Comedy and sarcasm will also be utilized to make the campaign lighthearted but also educational. Alleqaa anticipates that a local Libyan actor will be the voice of the Bakoo, in order to brand the campaign with a familiar local personality that is recognizable. The main target area for the flyer distribution will be Tripoli University, Martyr’s Square and the main downtown roads in Tripoli. 

These information products will be packaged in that there were be the distribution of three different flyers over the course of three weeks (one flyer every week) and in the fourth week, the Bakoo episode will be placed on Facebook and aired on TV and possibly radio. 

This activity assumes that by disseminating information about the constitution and election through flyers and TV, it will educate the public about the current transition stage that Libya is going through. Moreover, the public will be engaged in the political process and be able to more productively engage and debate the democratic transition.

Transition programming is crucial to support the dramatic changes occurring in Libya. There is wide support for this seismic change, and Libyans are eager to begin exercising freedom of expression and association while creating conditions for establishment of formal reformed political institutions and processes. Strategic communications and media play a key role in the development of a democratic Libya. With USAID/OTI support through this activity, a strategic communications and media consultant will be hired for several months to help in the development and functional use of strategic communications and media in Tripoli and Benghazi by civil society organizations and media outlets/partners that can enable Libyans to engage each other in Libya’s new democratic space, and allow for public engagement with citizens on key messages and issues.

Civil society is also a new development in post-revolutionary Libya and as such has similar issues to those of the media, in terms of under-developed communications and messaging mechanisms and skills. There is a need for assisting civil society organizations in developing strategic communications by presenting ideas clearly, concisely, persuasively and systematically in a timely manner to the right people maximizing available resources and engaging with media and public.  

Additionally, there is a need for the connection to be made between media and civil society in order to ensure that NGOs are both training in effective messaging and outreach, and have access to outlets for disseminating opinions and messages that come out of their programming. Civil society potentially has a wide source of information through their programming throughout the country, and provides the media with additional sources of messaging if they are engaged and understand the basic concepts of how to ensure information is shared and disseminated.

It is assumed that by increasing the engagement of civil society, media outlets and other media related actors in the dialogue and debate around key issues related to the transition that this will help them to leverage and connect with the government and citizens through messaging, public dialogue and debate on key issues. This in itself will increase the opportunities for the Libyan population to ensure their voices are heard in the lead up to the development of the constitution and elections.

",Getting the Word to the Public: Rapid Information Dissemination,"
Since the liberation of the country in August 2011, severe tensions have occurred during the transition process. Many Libyans do not understand the basic vocabulary on the fundamentals of democracy, constitution making and elections. This lack of understanding inhibits effective and productive dialogue on transitional issues that are currently ongoing in the country. Also by not understanding these issues, the population, especially youth and civil society, are constrained in their contributions and their ability to effectively participate in the process is weakened. Additionally, as civil society organizations have evolved out of the revolution, they often don’t have the capabilities to run effective workshops, organize outreach campaigns and design & develop messaging. Often, activity development takes a substantial amount of time and investment and cannot necessarily keep pace with the changes in the transition. 

As the draft of the electoral law has been submitted, the pace of the debate around the elections and constitution-making will increase. There is the need to have a quick and responsive mechanism that allows for the quick design and development of IEC materials, production and distribution of them. The structure of this activity would allow USAID/OTI to quickly design, procure and/or distribute key documents and materials in support of Libya’s political transition and democracy as the needs are identified. These documents and materials will help to provide important information resources to the new civil society organizations, government representatives and/or the public at large.  

This activity aims to support the development, provision, and/or delivery of existing or new IEC materials on Libya’s transition and move towards democracy in addition to providing a flexible information dissemination mechanism for other stakeholders, as necessary. Subject matter can range from the re-production of local materials on subjects such as vocabulary of democracy, outreach campaigns, and the 20 month road map to international materials on constitution making, democracy, and restructuring of the state.

Subsequently, other grants will be cleared to implement the dissemination of the materials after selection of appropriate grantees. Similarly, existing networks will also be utilized to disseminate the materials through previous, current, or potential grantees.

USAID/OTI assumes that printing and disseminating IEC materials on the transition and democracy will help in creating an environment for public dialogue. This will result in stakeholders being pressured to continue to support the transition and democracy in Libya.

",Beyond Booklets: Training Civil Society on the Transitional Roadmap,"
On October 23, the liberation of Libya was announced in Benghazi. In August 2011, the Transitional National Council (TNC) released the Constitutional Charter for the Transitional Stage and this document outlines the road map for this period. More specifically, Article 30 outlines and defines this way forward. A post-revolutionary Libya will be defined by complex social, political, and economic issues as the country moves towards the establishment of democratic governance. More fundamentally, democracy and transition are new terms in Libya and many Libyans do not understand the fundamentals of the transition period.

Youth played a pivotal role in the revolution and define a majority of the population in Libya. The median age of the country is approximately 24.5 years of age. Youth have become growingly frustrated with the new leadership for ignoring their input, dismissing their passion and taking for granted their support. In Tripoli, as elsewhere, Libyan youth have demonstrated a sophisticated level of interest in how the transition occurs and what the end results will be. Considering that youth constitute a formidable percentage of the population, there are many windows of opportunity for their empowerment and positive participation in this process. 

One such young group, H20, has identified that raising awareness around the TNC’s road map and generating an overall dialogue through information dissemination and outreach are needed in order for youth to engage in a more constructive dialogue on the next steps forward in the country. H20 is based in Tripoli and was founded by ten young individuals concerned about the transition process in their country and are supporting the positive contribution that youth can make during this process and the overall support that youth can provide in the development of an emerging democracy. They currently have a membership of 55 that is expanding with temporary office space in the capital. 

Under TRIP003, H2O has written and printed a booklet that outlines the transitional roadmap put forth by the Transitional Council. This booklet was developed to ensure that youth and the general public better understood the transitional process. The booklet depicts the transitional process as a 10-storey building built on the foundation of the revolution with each floor representing a critical milestone in the roadmap. 

This activity seeks to build on the foundation of TRIP003 by training 20 trainers from multiple civil society organizations on the details of the booklet and then deploying these organizations across the country to hold more workshops on the information included in the booklet. This activity assumes that by engaging youth and increasing their awareness on the country’s transition to a new government, they will be able to advance public expression and debate about the democratic transition.

",Walking the Walk: Interactive Training on the Role of Citizens in a Democracy,"
With the completion of the proliferation of the electoral law and swearing in of the Election Commission in February 2012, Libya has taken another step forward on the road to transition and democracy. Libyans could shy away from the country's first free elections later this year if more is not done to educate them about the vote. Raising awareness ahead of the June election for a national assembly, which will have the task of drawing up a constitution, is essential. An awareness process is very much needed so when a Libyan goes to the ballot, s/he can make a free conscious decision of what s/he wants. For people to understand and engage in a discourse that is essential in building consensus among Libyans during this transition period, the existing gap in understanding of these key issues needs to be addressed.  

Given that the majority of Libyans have never participated in an election or lived in a democratic society, there is a significant lack of knowledge about the role of citizens in a democratic system. Compounding this lack of knowledge is the fact that Libyans in the post-revolution period want change and they want it fast. It is in this context that this activity will utilize a highly interactive methodology to teach members of civil society about how the active role that citizens play in a democratic society. The events are set at 30 participants and each person has a societal ‘role’ (party candidate, media, government, etc.) to play and the instructors create scenarios that teach the group about how all of the people interact with each other. The events do not require prior knowledge of democracy, nor is it limited to certain levels of literacy as the events are interactive to ‘show’ how processes work. 

USAID/OTI expects that by giving more Libyans practical knowledge on their role and responsibilities within a democracy will ensure a more inclusive and peaceful transition.

",Promoting Outreach and Engagement to Civil Society in Libya,"
In February 2011, the regime of Muammar Qadhafi met popular protests in Eastern Libya with brutal violence, which led to a popular revolution that ultimately brought his 42-year reign to an end. The representative Transitional National Council (TNC), formed to steer Libya’s transition to democracy, has developed a road map that lays out constitutional and electoral processes that would establish a democratically elected government by mid-2013. Alongside these efforts, new political freedoms have ushered in emerging civil society organizations and independent media outlets working to promote the spirit of change in Libya. 

USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (USAID/OTI) launched the Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) in July 2011 to support Libyan efforts to build an inclusive and accountable democratic government that reflects the will and needs of the Libyan people.  

Specifically, USAID/OTI aims to:

1.  Support transitional political processes
2.  Promote reconciliation
3.  Build transparency and legitimacy of governance

In the current phase, as the TNC develops the formal institutions that will guide the country toward elections and the establishment of a new government, USAID/OTI has identified an urgent need to ensure the voice of everyday citizens, especially women and youth, are amplified and able to participate in the historic transition to a democratic Libya. As the political process continues to evolve, USAID/OTI’s rapid response ability will be well suited to meet additional unforeseen needs that may emerge. Activities implemented by USAID/OTI to date include:

*  Helping civil society organizations improve organizational capacity to effectively represent the public during the transition; 
*  Public outreach campaigns to keep citizens informed about the transition process; 
*  Support to emerging independent media outlets to improve the quality of information and advance the capacity of the media sector to serve as a conduit for public exchange; 
*  Human rights trainings to help citizens understand, prevent, and document abuses; 
*  Workshops that facilitate dialogue between Libyan citizens, members of the transitional government, and international experts to help develop participatory processes for government formation.  

Purpose

Working under the broad supervision of the USAID/OTI country representative and LTI chief of party and will need to exert an important degree of independent judgment and initiative. The Outreach and Engagement Specialist will play a major role in supporting and development materials and training for outreach and engagement with civil society in Libya. The advisor will then work with civil society groups to develop outreach and awareness raising grants for implementation through LTI when and where relevant. The advisor will also work in coordination with the STTA in the media center to develop guidelines for developing a wider framework on communication outreach as part of the road map process for government engagement with civil society.  

Duration and Location

It is estimated that approximately two-three months of level of effort will be required but is contingent upon USAID/OTI approval. This assignment will be conducted in both Benghazi and Tripoli and may require extensive travel to other areas of Libya.

",Building Libyan Women’s Strategic Approaches and Toolkits for Action,"
Libya has undergone a transformation over the past year, with the end of Gaddafi’s rule and eventual assumption of power of a new government on November 26, 2011. Libyans now face a critical transition process that will include the establishment of bodies that will lay the foundation for elections, reforms, democratic institution building, and constitution development.  Key to this transition will be the establishment of a vibrant, independent civil society that includes the leadership, advocacy, networking and mobilization of Libyan women.  

Elections are scheduled for late June 2012. A constitutional assembly will be constituted pursuant to the elections. Civil society participation in this process is key, but very few in Libya have knowledge of or experience with democracy, elections, or constitutions. This is particularly true for women, who despite their active participation in the revolution, lack the necessary organizational capacity to speak as one voice in the political process. A number of women’s organizations and CSOs exist, but these are under developed, under resourced and in need of support to play a leading role in Libya’s transition to democracy.  Furthermore, these women’s organizations are disjointed, and not very well networked with one another , limiting their effectiveness and ability to meaningfully participate  and contribute to the policy making process.  

Women-led organizations can play a leading role in creating a more participatory prosperous and democratic society if provided the skills, knowledge, support and opportunity to actively participate as a unified/collaborative force in the political process.  It is this context that this activity will support a key women-led Libyan organization to hold a workshop that focuses on strategies for the participants to ensure women’s active participation in the election and beyond. Additionally, the activity will include technical assistance to other Libyan women’s groups to assist them in better organizing their ideas and providing recommendations for how the LTI can support these organizations and initiatives in the future. 

This activity assumes that women’s participation in Libya’s transition is essential to the success and the sustainability of the future of Libya. This activity also assumes that women-led organizations in Libya have high levels of capacity, it is important that their efforts be coordinated and focused.

",Training of Trainers for Domestic Elections Observation,"
The first nation-wide election to be held in Libya in four decades is quickly approaching in June 2012, with the ambitious goal of fairly electing a national assembly to draft a constitution. Currently, awareness of the elections process is low among Libyan citizens, though there is an expressed desire for more information. The country’s lack of experience with elections and past history of corruption, raise significant fears about the fairness and transparency of the upcoming vote. An increase in understanding of the elections process and what constitutes fair, transparent elections will be essential in establishing expectations and fostering confidence in elections results. 

This activity aims to increase awareness of elections procedures by training trainers from civil society on the importance of and procedures involved in domestic election observation so that they can conduct subsequent trainings in other regions and cities. In coordination with the National Democratic Institute (NDI), an organization that has conducted similar trainings of trainers throughout the world including a recent training in Benghazi, the activity will provide qualified experts to conduct the training of trainers to civil society members from all around Libya in the cities of Tripoli, Sabha, Sabratah, and Sousa with the goal of training 100 civil society members from all around Libya in elections observation. The selection of the four cities was designed to cover most areas of the country to reach civil society groups from various regions. 

The League of Civil Society Organizations in Misratah, who recently helped to organize and manage its city’s local council elections, identified the need for trained, local elections observers to serve as resources on elections procedures and monitor and report on the upcoming national elections. The organization’s past experience conducting the Misratah local elections, commitment to empowering civil society, and extensive network of civil society organizations across various sectors make the League the ideal partner for organizing trainings.

Each training event will span two days and content will include basic information on elections and specific guidelines for conducting elections observer training. Content will include contributions from the expert trainers and lessons learned from the local elections in Misratah. The result will be 100 trained elections observer trainers that will be able to hold similar training events in their home areas throughout the country. The training events are purposefully held in four regions of the country to ensure that there is a regional ‘feel’ to the events instead of bringing everyone to Tripoli or Benghazi. A secondary outcome of these events will be that the participants will visit different regions of the country which will indirectly allow them to share information about their thoughts on the transition. The element of intra-regional information sharing is an important element to these events as Libya is experiencing a national debate on federalism and other complex transitional issues. This will allow Libyans from around the country to share thoughts on these issues and 'see' how the positions of other regional actors. 

A significant outcome of the events should be that each trainee leaves the events with an action plan and the materials necessary to teach other people about elections observation. An important outcome of the training events is that the trainees are given information on how to register as an official election observer with their local election constituency offices.

This activity will encourage transparency, reduce corruption and promote efficiency in the production, sales and profit utilization in the most critical industry to an effective and peacefull democractic transition in Libya. In particular, this grant will translate the Libya Oil Almanac into Arabic and implement a set of training and outreach events to ensure that accurate information about the country's most valuable economic resource is available to all Libyans.

",Open Oil: Increasing Access to Information on Libya’s Oil Resources,"
Libya's oil industry is worth some $50 billion a year and is vital to the country's economic future, and yet reliable and independent information in Arabic is nonexistent. Information about the oil sector was largely held by the ruling members of the Qadhafi regime. In the months following the overthrow of the regime, there is a strong need for accurate information in Arabic to be disseminated as there are many misperceptions about the oil sector. Misperceptions about the sector have the potential to create conflict as various regional and tribal actors jockey for their rights in the new constitution which naturally include a share of the country’s most valuable resource. 

Currently, there is a public call for information about Libya’s oil sector. Due to lack of resources, the National Transitional Council has kept the National Oil Company and the former staff in charge of the sector until changes can be made. The Company has faced significant allegations of corruption including the whereabouts of $650 million which has led to an arrest warrant of the former head of the Company during the revolution. The Company is not transparent and has resisted attempts to publically share information about the sector. 

It is in this context that this activity proposed to translate and localize Open Oil’s Libya Oil Almanac which has already been produced in English and available on the Web (http://libya.wiki.openoil.net) and in ebook format (URL).  Open Oil is an energy research and policy consultancy based in Berlin. It focuses on the transparency and governance of the oil and gas industry in support of the people of producing nations. The Almanac is an open source reference on Libya’s oil industry. The project will embed the translation of the prototype into a wiki, train a team of local journalists to use and extend the wiki, and aim to establish a reference source that is maintained by local journalists in collaboration with the grantee. The project will also print 1,000 copies of the first edition of the book for immediate distribution in Tripoli and Benghazi and other centers, to promote awareness of the project and to reach parts of Libyan society not yet fully plugged in to the Internet and digital culture.

Libya’s National Transitional Council has produced a roadmap for the transition which includes national elections and the writing of a new constitution. The project assumes that the oil guide will provide more regulated and independent information that is not available at the moment. This will provide people who want to participate in the constitutional drafting with more information regarding this valuable resource for the country. Iraq is an example of a country where a lack of public understanding about its oil sector has led to the five-year delay of framework legislation which has kept the Iraqi oil industry from stabilizing. The writers of the Iraqi constitution were not fully versed on all of the details of the country’s oil sector which has led to a destabilizing political battle on appropriate legislation controlling the sector. 

Additionally, this activity assumes the information will be important for both the upcoming elections. It will provide candidates and the public information regarding strategies and policies around commitments on how to utilize and distribute oil resources. With this guide, advocates can have information to inform their positions and to raise questions to political candidates. The grantee is working with Revenue Watch Institute to plan a training on revenue management for oil revenues for the political candidates before the upcoming elections for which this guide will be a tool.

",A Nation Reborn: Promoting and Developing Photojournalism in Libya,"
Media and photography in particular, have had an instrumental role in Libya’s revolution, its fight for freedom and the evolution of events. Images of the events in Libya were broadcast to the world from the first days of the revolution via mobile phones and computers of ordinary citizens. Later, professional photographers took brave, and sometimes fatal, positions in capturing and documenting images from the frontline or under dangerous circumstances. As can be seen in Libya, the role of photography and photojournalism in capturing the moments in a nation’s history through the lens of a camera can move people to take action and make a difference.

In a country where free media has been suppressed for decades, media outlets will need support to grow and develop in order to actively participate in the transition in a positive way. The role of media in the important upcoming transitional steps, especially the planned election, will have an impact on how well citizens understand and support the events. It is in this context that this activity will support the development of photojournalists through training, but it will also utilize pictures captured during the revolution as a tool to tell Libya’s story of freedom and unity. 

Under the theme of ‘A Tribute to the Past, A Step towards the Future’, this activity will implement a series of photography-related events that will build the capacity of photojournalists in Libya. The activity will utilize a competition and exhibition to highlight the difficulties that Libya has faced, but also show how a united Libya is moving toward a bright future. Selected photojournalists will be provided intensive training in order to create a core set of highly-trained photojournalists in Libya. With an eye towards creating linkages between various societal groups (e.g., ethnic, tribal, geographic, political, etc.), the activity will also use photographs taken before, during, and after the revolution to remind Libyans of where they have been and where they are going. These photographs will be collected through a nationwide competition and winners will be incorporated into an exhibition. 

This activity assumes that educating and reminding the public about Libya’s revolution will motivate Libyans to work collaboratively towards peaceful solutions in its current transition. This activity also assumes that better trained photojournalists play a key role in telling accurate stories about Libya’s transition. In a country where free media has been suppressed for decades, media outlets and especially photojournalists will need support to grow and develop in order to actively participate in the transition in a positive way. The role of media in the important upcoming transitional steps, especially the planned election, will have an impact on how well citizens understand and support the events.

",Reaching Out: Awareness on Transitioning Militias into Civilian Life,"
Libya is flooded with weapons from more than 40 years of rule under Gaddafi that resulted in the aggressive purchase of weapons amounting to $30 billion. During the Libyan uprising against Gaddafi normal civilians and professionals who had never held arms before joined militia groups with minimal to no training. Today many are finding it challenging to adjust to civilian life. Psychological trauma from the loss of family and friends and the violence experienced, as well as the high unemployment rate are some of the reasons some militias have not disbanded yet. There have been efforts to incorporate the militias to the national army in Tripoli, but they have limited success to date. The overflow of weapons in Libya is also emerging as a regional security threat; with reports of a growing black market and the smuggling of Libyan light weapons to Gaza through Egypt and through the Tuareg trading route that stretches as far as West Africa. In Libya, militias continue to control certain areas and street fights often erupt with these groups pointing their guns at each other as a result of trivial arguments.  

Libya is witnessing its first election soon and it’s believed that no true democracy can be practiced if weapons are still present on the streets. Therefore, making Libya a weapon –free zone as soon as possible is one of the most urging priorities and most difficult challenges at the same time. The Libyan citizens should practice their right to vote based on their choice and not forced by power or arms presence that instills an environment of intimidation. 

As Libyans are very optimistic about their future, the recent cracks in the transition have illustrated the sensitivity of the current context and the need to support the process of peace transition. A local women’s group, Phoenix Libya and based in Tripoli, is currently working on prompting on large-scale awareness campaign titled “price of freedom”. 
This campaign aims to raise awareness about major social/cultural issues that stand in the face of the peaceful transition to a stable democratic country.  

The second episode of the “Price of Freedom” campaign is going to be titled ‘Rebuilding Libya’. The objective of this episode is to encourage armed militias to leave their weapons and join civil life again and to remind them that war has ended and the time has come to rebuild the new civilized country that all Libyans have sacrificed so much for. Different media mechanisms will be used for this episode including TV, billboards, flyers, and internet.
 
This campaign will directly target freedom fighters who still carry their weapons as the campaign materials will feature armed freedom fighters leaving their weapons and transforming into a carefully selected characters (doctor, a graduate student, an engineer and a policemen) showing  a sense of hope to the bright future and countless opportunities a civilized country can offer to them. 

All campaign materials will emphasize the importance handling the militias’ weapons to the government, and focus on motivating the militias to start working and building their country. The characters featured in the campaign have been selected carefully to present all the professions (doctors, engineers, teachers, students, etc.) and will be promoted through different media outlets including TV, radio, billboards, flyers and social media. The main content of the outreach campaign developed is around militias, representative from all around Libya. 

This activity assumes that by widely disseminating information on major social issues that challenging the country while emphasizing the integration of the militias in the civic life and will promote positive dialogue and peaceful atmosphere during the transition period.

",Report Out of Rapid Assessment of the Media Landscape in Libya,"
Media plays a key role in the development of a democratic Libya. Upcoming education and information outreach campaigns will be particularly important for the success of Libyan parliamentary and presidential elections that are planned for mid-2012. This campaign will rely in part on an effective education of the population, a process in which independent, rights-based mass media and Libyan NGOs will play an important role. A  rapid  assessment  of  the  Libyan  media  landscape will  be  a  necessary  first  step  to  ensuring subsequent work in either the media sector or education campaigns is effectively targeted. USAID/OTI has the opportunity to bolster Libya’s transition by supporting, among other initiatives; the development of a focused, durable and capable Libyan civil society the development of an independent, rights-based media and public education campaigns regarding human and civil rights and responsibilities.

In November 2011, USAID/OTI funded a rapid assessment of the media landscape and consumption habits in five major cities of Libya, as well as ongoing public information campaigns. The assessment provides recommendations for the most effective channels for rolling out public education campaigns on human and civil rights and responsibilities. In order to ensure that this information is used at its fullest capacity, this activity now aims to hold two presentations about these findings with government officials and create simple summaries of the findings in Arabic and English that can be distributed to local government officials and civil society to assist in more effective public information campaigns. This activity assumes that a better informed government about how Libyans consume media will help more create more targeted communications during this critical part of Libya’s transition.

In order to promote a peaceful democratic transition in Libya, this activity will strengthen the capacity and engagement of actor involved in guiding the country's transitional justice and reconciliation process. After decades of divide and rule tactics by the Qadhafi regime, followed by intense fighting among communities during the revolution and series of human rights abuses and retaliations, the Libyan social fabric contains many open wounds that must be addressed before national reconciliation and inclusive governance can proceed. In particular, this activity will bring in an international team of experts in transitional justice to build bridges between multiple actors involved in the transitional justice process, and increase the dialogue between government officials, local leaders, and the relevant players in the non-governmental organization (NGO) community on a transitional justice strategy for Libya. The Public International Law & Policy Group (PILPG), who has extensive experience assisting government officials with transitional justice issues and war crimes prosecution, will build the capacity of these actors to understand options available to them based on international best practices and lessons learned in the field of transitional justice. As a result, these actors will develop a strategic plan to implement a holistic transitional justice program that reflects the views of multiple stakeholders.

",Strategic Planning to Implement the Libyan Transitional Justice Law,"
Following the Libyan revolution that began in February 2011, there is a clear desire and expectation within Libya for justice and accountability to form part of the backbone of Libya’s transition from dictatorship to democracy. In particular, Libya has to address past violations during the conflict in 2011 (and subsequent events) and during the 42 years of the Gaddafi regime, to support an effective transition from authoritarianism to democracy and the rule of law. 

Across Libya, actors and communities insist that important and practical steps for maintaining peace and normalizing relations will be contingent upon an effective justice process for past crimes. And that without widespread acceptance that justice has been provided, Libya will not be able to move forward to create a unified and inclusive democratic state and stable nation.

Transitional justice mechanisms are essential to stability and sustainable peace in Libya. Transitional justice mechanisms should be created to deal with crimes that were committed during the conflict period, at a stage where the Libyan people were at the prominence of transition from a society of conflict to one of democracy and peace, post February 17 revolution.  

This strategic grant focused on transitional justice will have three phases.  In the first phase, PILPG’s transitional justice experts will complete a detailed mapping of the relevant Libyan actors and their roles with regard to transitional justice, including national reconciliation efforts, prosecution, and reparations.

This would include the relevant actors (1) within the National Transitional Council, the new Libya National Congress to be elected on June 19, and the Libyan government; (2) working on transitional justice at a local level (such as the local reconciliation committees); and (3) the NGOs working on national reconciliation and justice issues (collectively referred to as “Transitional Justice Actors”). The mapping exercise will require in-depth interviews and assessments with Transitional Justice Actors to inform the next two phases of the project.  The mapping will determine the relevant actors, the political considerations, and the main substantive questions facing the officials and actors involved with shaping the transitional justice system.  The purpose of this phase is to provide the grantee a baseline determination of the knowledge of Transitional Justice Actors, determine the topics for the training sessions, develop relationships with the relevant Transitional Justice Actors to get their buy-in to the remaining program activities, and identify NGOs to participate in the outreach phase of the program.
	 
In the second phase, PILPG will conduct a series of trainings and strategic planning sessions designed to assist Transitional Justice Actors to create a holistic transitional justice strategy.  PILPG will provide trainings on relevant international law and practice, best practices and lessons learned from other transitional justice programs, and broader transitional justice issues.  The strategic planning sessions will provide these institutions a venue to come together to develop a detailed implementation plan, based on the knowledge gained through the trainings.  The strategic plan developed through these sessions will include mechanisms and a framework for:  (1) effective and fair prosecutions; (2) judicial independence and witness protection; (3) national reconciliation; and (4) an outreach strategy to involve local actors, NGOs, and other stakeholders.

Finally, in the third phase, PILPG will assist the relevant Libyan institutions in implementing a pilot program to test the outreach activities developed in the strategic plan.  Using the mapping completed by PILPG during the first phase of the project, the pilot program will involve those NGOs and local leaders working in the area of transitional justice, with a specific emphasis on involving women and youth. The pilot program will be designed to solicit the input of these actors, as a first step in implementing the strategic plan’s outreach activities and ensuring stakeholder ownership over the final transitional justice strategy. The pilot program would include activities in Tripoli, Benghazi, Misrata and Sabha and include a broad range of actors playing a role in Libya’s transition to a democratic state founded on the rule of law. The objective of the pilot outreach training program is that Transitional Justice Actors begin to incorporate public input into the strategic planning framework document created in the first phase.  As a result, when implemented the transitional justice strategy will be inclusive of the opinions of Libyan citizen’s and, therefore, seen as the proper channel to respond to prior abuses and crimes.
	
This grant will build bridges between multiple actors involved in the transitional justice process, and increase the dialogue between government officials, local leaders, and the relevant players in the NGO community. PILPG will build the capacity of these actors to understand options available to them based on international best practices and lessons learned in the field of transitional justice. As a result, these actors will develop a strategic framework plan to implement a holistic transitional justice program that reflects the views of multiple stakeholders. If the plan is based on best practices and lessons learned from the transitional justice field and all stakeholders feel a level of ownership over the process, then the implementation and execution of the transitional justice strategy will effectively and appropriately respond to Libyan people’s need for justice and reconciliation.

",Now See This! Observing a Historical Moment on Elections in Libya,"
With the completion of the electoral law and swearing in of the Election Commission in February 2012, Libya has taken another step forward on the road to democracy.  The High Commission for Elections announced the country’s first free elections on July 7th of this year. Supporting the observation of the upcoming national assembly elections is an essential step for democratic processes in Libya. Therefore, by supporting organizations who are training election observers, and by providing them with the materials and equipment needed, Libyans will have a visual marker and a stronger sense of confidences in the process when they go to the polling stations to cast their first ballot. 

Given that the majorities of Libyans under age 60 years old have never participated in an election nor lived in a democratic society, there is a significant lack of knowledge about the role of elections observers in a democratic system. In order to address this need, Shahed in cooperation with NDI, held an intense series of trainings on elections observation. They provided training on observing the elections in Tripoli, Misratah, Zawia, Sabha Sirt and Benghazi for local observers in 13 constituencies throughout Libya.

Election Day will be a very visible and visual experience for Libyans. The identification and prominence of election monitors at the polling stations will reinforce the legitimacy and value of the election process. 

This activity aims to provide all the necessary materials and equipment to ensure that the voting process at different polling stations across the country is transparent and any witnessed violations will be reported and documented.

This activity aims to ensure the participation of Libya’s youth in the country’s first national elections in 42 years by working with a youth-based NGO called H2O to conduct a 3-day voter education campaign that targets a total of 16,000 students in Tripoli’s two largest universities; Tripoli University and Nasir University and to disseminate 16,000 voter education pamphlets to them. As well as to implement a 3-day registration and voter education outreach campaign in 10 high-schools located in Tripoli’s 13 electoral districts targeting 20,000 students and citizens. Libya’s youth played a pivotal role in bringing about change during the country’s revolution that brought an end to 42 years of Qaddafi’s authoritarian rule. Today their participation in the country’s democratic processes is key to the success of the transitional period given that they constitute more than 60 percent of the country’s population.

",Get Out and Vote: Voter Education Targeting Educational Institutions in Tripoli,"
Libya is quickly approaching its first national elections scheduled for mid-June 2012. Youth make up more than 60 percentage of the population, and are therefore a critical group to target in Libya’s transition to democracy and to ensure their effective participation as informed and engaged citizens who will shape the future of Libya.

The grantee, H2O was approached by Higher National Electoral Commission (HNEC) to develop a voter education booklet that is now ready for distribution. The 15-page illustrated voter education booklet takes citizens through each step of the voting procedure from registering to vote, to announcing the final results of the elections. The manual includes information such as, what elections are, who is eligible to vote, why one should vote; the documentation needed at the polling station to permit citizens to vote, and the voting procedure. In addition to civic education messages on citizenship duties and rights. This manual will be the main outreach tool for activities under this grant.

The grantee will also target 10 schools for a 2-day voter registration campaign. The schools will be selected from Tripoli's 13 electoral districts and they will all be voter registration centers in main streets that tend to be busy during the rush hour and at the end of the school day. The objective is to reach out to parents and citizens in the vicinity of the school so as to capture the largest audience possible.

","Understanding the Context at a Local Level in Dernah, Kufra, Nafusa & Sabha","
Transition programming is crucial to support the dramatic changes occurring in Libya. Outreach, engagement, and participatory techniques are new to Libyans as are political processes. Targeted Analytical Scoping/Conflict Mapping is a theme recently emerging from the July 2012 Rolling Assessment. 

There is a need to contact universities around the country to identify resource experts around the country to identify resource experts on topics and communities related to program strategy. This work will begin by mapping key actors and potential local partners in the respective areas of Derna, Kufra, Sabha and Nafusa Mountains which are considered conflict-prone/underrepresented in Libya. 

The information obtained under this activity will contribute to analytical and mapping work needed to further focus program activities to increase impact. In terms of community/border security, the objective will be to identify local partner institutions whose capacity could be built to conduct mapping and analytical work to better understand and engage particular communities and address underlying grievances. 
The support from this activity will focus on identification of information and resources, target actors, and areas for active engagement and dialogue that will be utilized in transition related programming.

	Continued disenfranchisement of some communities and associated grievances is an important factor contributing to border insecurity and creating pockets of more recruitable youth for extremists groups. Communities such as the Tebou, Twarge and Taureg and Darna town are most at-risk for disenfranchisement and cooptation and should be a focus of productive engagement activities and the Nafusa Mountains (home to a substantial Amazigh population). 

This activity will support hiring local-level resources to facilitate obtaining information in the above identified areas.

",Women Now! Amplifying Women’s Voices through Enabling Female Candidates,"
In mid-June 2012 Libyans are scheduled to vote in the first national elections in more than four decades. The outcome of this election will determine the members who will take the 200 seats in the National Assembly that will appoint the constitution-drafting committee.

For the last couple of months state authorities have been busy organizing the elections, writing laws and regulations to hold them, and most recently mobilizing citizens to register to vote on election day. The Election Commission has been struggling with the voter registration and voter education campaigns and getting timely and consistent information out to Libyans. This is a massive task and state capacity is limited and time is running out. USAID-OTI/Chemonics are well positioned to support the nascent Libyan civil society to play a more efficient role in reaching out to citizens through voter education public awareness activities to ensure the informed participation of the maximum number of citizens, including traditionally marginalized groups such as women, youth and the disabled. Additionally, the in-kind mechanism and flexibility of the LTI program is well suited to respond to rapid requests for support to information of key election information and processes.

The participation of Libyan women at the executive and local levels of governance remains limited after the country’s revolution, especially outside the urban centers and more conservative and traditional suburbs. This is mainly due to the limited capacities and knowledge about the foundations of democratic governance. However, the informed participation of women in Libya’s forthcoming elections is vital to the successes of this milestone in the country’s trajectory to democratic transformation. 

This activity aims to build the capacity of 25 Libyan women who have registered to be candidates for the National Congress Election and who represent East, West, Center and Southern Libya. This will be done through a six-day training aimed at increasing the capacity of these female candidates.  The training will be conducted by the Tunis-based NGO, Center of Arab Women for Training and Research (CAWTAR). It will include themes that address a host of relevant skills such as: communication skills, good governance and gender, human rights and elections. The aim is to increase the quality and efficacy of female candidates’ participation during Libya’s National Congress Elections.  

COWTAR is a research center founded in 1993 and focused on gender equality and on building the capacity of women and men in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region through a rights-based approach. They have experience conducting trainings and trainings of trainers (TOTs) on topics that include: combating gender-based violence; women’s leadership and participation in political life and decision-making processes; reproductive health; entrepreneurship; and human rights-based approaches for local development, to mention a few. Moreover, COWTAR has trained women and men from all over the MENA region including: Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman and Tunisia. Their target audience includes governmental institutions, NGOs, advocacy groups, research centers, practitioners and regional and international organizations. Throughout the years COWTAR has created a number of training kits, often with collaboration with experts in the MENA region (e.g., “Regional Training Kit for Trainers on Building Capacities of Service While Working on GBV Elimination”).

July 7, 2012 will be the 1st election for Libya in 42 years and the country is at a dangerous crossroads. With recent security incidents in the past several weeks, the postponement of the election, and a voter education campaign by the High National Election Commission (HNEC) that has yet to be launched, Libyans have become increasingly frustrated with the transitional government and tangible progress. These elections must go well and ensure that a legitimate government is elected in order for the country to move forward in the transition. This activity aims to increase access to and understanding of the upcoming election in Libya by supporting the local production of ten 30-60 minute TV show episodes through a local producer, Shout Advertising Agency, around the theme of “Libya Elections Live”. The series will be filmed around the country and in Tripoli and will be aired three weeks prior to Election Day in Libya. This nonpartisan “election  central” series will cover topics per voter education and the lead-up to the election and will be important to assuring it’s success.

",Libya Elections Live! TV Shows in the Lead-Up to Election Day,"
In mid-June 2012, Libya will experience a landmark moment as it proceeds to the polls for the first free elections in most of its young population’s lifetime. The significance of this election is underscored by the fact that the national representatives elected in turn will determine the members who will take the 200 seats in the National Assembly that will appoint the Constitution-drafting committee. This election cycle will also establish how elections will be organized and regulated going forward. It is expected that the election will be postponed but will be held prior to Ramadan. 
Not surprisingly, Libya has seen a surge of political activity, which is also very confusing. The number of registered political entities now exceeds 370 and candidates say all kind of things to entice the voters. Despite the efforts of the political parties to hold conference and media events, many Libyans are waiting for more information on the process itself in addition to the electoral campaigns before they decide how to vote – so it is difficult at present to predict the outcome.
This activity aims to develop a television series shot on location in Libya that will become the “go to” source for Libyans looking for information about the Libyan elections:  Libya Elections Live. The show will function as “election central” for a Libyan audience. Conceptually, it will present nonpartisan coverage of the history of elections in Libya, the election timeline/process, nuts and bolts of the election law, districting, voting simulation, ballot design, campaign finance, suffrage including  female and minority representation, election  campaigning, party platforms, election  monitoring, transparency in counting  the vote, responsibilities of elected  representatives, the drafting of the Libyan constitution, and current political issues evolving in Libya. The format will involve interviews and moderated panel discussions with candidates, party leaders, political analysts, civil society groups working to demystify the electoral process, and the Libyan man/woman on the street. It is also likely that election related events, such as debates and rallies will be filmed as part of the show.
Libya Elections Live will be made for Libyans by Libyans. Libyan civil society strategist and senior advisor to the Ministry of Culture and Civil Society, Zahra’ Langham will be the face of the show.  As host, she will conduct one-on-one interviews and moderate panel discussions. Shows will be conceptualized, written, and planned as a collaborative effort between Langham, Lynch, and the creative team of Shout, a Tripoli communications agency. Fresh off a voting awareness campaign targeting Libyan women, Shout will handle art direction, directing, and cinematography.  An expert on Libya’s electoral law, Langham was integrally involved in developing the unique hybrid electoral process designed to ensure the involvement of women in Libyan government.  As cofounder of Libyan Women’s Peace Platform, she has collaborated with UN Women and is currently presenting workshops to train women and youth campaigners in strategic communications skills.  Filmed on location in voting districts throughout the country, the show will be distinctively pan-Libyan, incorporating regional leadership figures and cultural landmarks.   The goal is to have a fully Libyan staffed production crew (with the exception of Lynch).
Ten 30-60 minute shows will be filmed and aired in the three weeks prior to the election date.  Footage will be shot on video using two to five cameras, according to segment. Dialogue will be in Arabic.  If audience research indicates that adding an English voiceover version will enable reaching a wider audience in the diaspora, this component will be added. The show will be promoted via print, radio, and social networking sites. Corresponding newspaper articles will be written in Arabic and English.
In summary, the objective is to provide the information that Libyans will need prior to going to the polls, facilitating a comfort level with and understanding of the electoral process. The interview format will encourage critical thinking and informed decision making, ensuring that the first free Libyan elections will be fair, transparent, and successful. Libya Elections Live will become the “go to” place for Libyans to catch up with the latest in election developments. Some of the furniture from the set will be able to be donated after the show is done filming. LTI will work with Shout to identify the best option for donation.

Constructive dialogue and increased awareness about human rights will be an important topic during the writing of the Libyan constitution. While the significance of human rights has remained a constant topic of discussion since the 2011 revolution, there are still high levels of misunderstanding about what human rights protection means in practical terms. By hosting a four day documentary film festival on the importance of human rights, this activity aims to act as a platform from which Libyans, primarily young people, will be able to discuss the importance of human rights in the post-revolution period.

",Looking at Human Rights from Different Perspectives-Tripoli Hosts Film Festival!,"
Since the liberation of Libya in August 2011, there continues to be high public interest for open and inclusive dialogue on a wide range of topics which are considered critical to laying the foundation for a successful political transition. One of the many areas of interest is the protection of human rights in a post-revolution Libya. Civil society organizations such as the National Awareness Movement (NAM) are attempting to address the demand for more information through the coordination of events that create a platform for debate and dialogue regarding the role of human rights in a democratic Libya.

In Tripoli, as elsewhere, Libyan youth have demonstrated a sophisticated level of interest in how Libya’s political transition occurs and what the end results will be. Considering that youth constitute a formidable percentage of the population, there are many windows of opportunity for their empowerment and positive participation in this process.

As a result, NAM intends to hold a four-day documentary film festival on human rights that seeks to create a platform for debate and discussion. The festival will have several screening of six films that will explore the political, social, economic, ethnic, and gender dimensions of human rights. The aim of the human rights film festival is to use documentaries to raise the awareness of Libyan society in the area of human rights, an initiate a dialogue between various stakeholders with a particular focus on youth.

Acknowledging the critical role youth have in the ongoing development of Libya, NAM’s long term vision is to organize annual film festivals across the country to 1) raise awareness of human rights and 2) motivate the youth to document their perspective through film. Depending on the success of TRIP038 and the availability of future funding, NAM hopes to have follow on festivals in historically marginalized communities later this year. 

NAM was founded after Tripoli was liberated in August 2011, and was officially registered in November 2011. It is comprised of a group of young, educated and highly motivated Libyan youth, who seek to participate in making a positive change in Libyan society, and to contribute to the improvement of the intellectual aspect of Libyan life. 

Although TRIP038 will be the Libya Transition Initiative’s first partnership with the organization, NAM participated in several training programs in democracy and good governance that were sponsored by the European Union and other donors including a workshop on ""Movies that Matter for Human Rights"". NAM also implemented activities such as the ""I Pledge"" campaign and the ""I Clean"" campaign, as well as a workshop on governance and separation of powers at Tripoli University.

The southern part of Libya, including the districts of Sabha, Murzuq, Wadi Al Hayat and Ghat, is maintaining a delicate balance amongst Arab, Tebou and Taurag groups but the potential for conflict, as in March 2012 showed, are still quite possible. The area though seen by many as favored under Qadhafi was marginalized and unrepresented and continues to feel disconnected from the political process during this critical period under the new government. However, the area had a high voter turnout for the July 2012 national election which illustrates the desire of the population to be engaged in the political process. This activity aims to develop and print three editions (3,050 copies each edition) of an 8-page monthly newspaper focused on critical issues of the transitional period such as the constitution drafting process for distribution to key communities in southern Libya.

",Spreading the Written Word! Newspaper on Critical Issues in the South!,"
With the successful completion of elections in July 2012, Libya has taken another step forward on the road to transition and democracy. The constitutional drafting process will be the next challenge as Libyans enter another phase in the process of creating a new political system. This system will be shaped by the inclusive nature of the drafting process and the government’s ability to balance the political power among the many groups that participated in the uprising and still hold sway in the country. Addressing feelings of resentment in many areas and getting troubled regions fully vested in rule-bound democratic politics is certainly a wider challenge than just technical arrangements for drafting the constitution. As a result, raising awareness on the constitution writing process, as well as the role and responsibilities of the national assembly, is essential. 

The southern part of Libya, including the districts of Sabha, Murzuq, Wadi Al Hayat and Ghat, is maintaining a delicate balance amongst Arab, Tebou and Taurag groups but the potential for conflict, as in March 2012 showed, are still quite possible. The area though seen by many as favored under Qadhafi was marginalized and unrepresented and continues to feel disconnected from the political process during this critical period under the new government.  For people to understand and engage in a discourse that is essential in building consensus among Libyans during this transitional period, access to and distribution of information needs to increase, especially in traditionally marginalized communities of Southern Libya. 

An Altai rapid media assessment supported by USAID/OTI in February 2012 showed that many Libyans in the southern areas, Sabha specifically, depend on newspapers as a primary source of information. As a result, the Libyan Transition Initiative (LTI) will partner with Sada Altajuma, a monthly civil society newspaper founded in January 2012. 

Sada Altajuma emerged as a communication tool early in 2011 by highlighting several political and social events that took place either in southern Libya or on the national level. To date, Sada Altajuma has produced three editions (in Arabic).  The most recent publication of the newspaper was approximately 1,000 copies and Sada Altajuma plans to increase the circulation to 3,000 copies to cover most of the southern cities in and around the Sebha area. Wanting to see an uptick of engagement in the political process in traditionally disenfranchised communities, Sada Altajuma is targeting people from different ages and backgrounds including Twareg and Tebu tribes in the region.

The Sada Altjuma newspaper is intended to be a platform for debate and discussion on topics surrounding political transition including constitutional drafting and political and social changes. This activity assumes by engaging the public and increasing their level of awareness during the transition through the dissemination of information on critical issues, it will advance public expression and open dialogue, as well as set the stage for an inclusive political process.

In Misratah, as elsewhere, Libyan youth have demonstrated a sophisticated level of interest in how Libya’s Constitutional Charter for the Transitional Stage will be implemented, especially in the run up to the first elections scheduled for July 7. This activity will support the provision of information to youth in Misratah on the official transitional timeline by utilizing a successful booklet that graphically depicts the steps in the timeline and process. A local organization, Rights without Borders founded in response to the need for awareness on transitional issues and based in Misratah, will conduct a three-day outreach and awareness campaign using booklets and content that was developed with the support of USAID/OTI under a previous activity with grantee H20.

",Beyond Booklets: Raising Awareness in Misratah on the Transitional Roadmap,"
On October 23, the liberation of Libya was announced in Benghazi. In August 2011, the National Transition Council (NTC) released the Constitutional Charter for the transitional stage in Libya. More specifically, Article 30 outlines the transition timeline. A post-revolutionary Libya will be defined by complex social, political, and economic issues as the country moves towards establishing democratic governance. More fundamentally, democracy and transition are new terms in Libya and many Libyans do not understand the fundamentals of the transition period.

Youth played a pivotal role in the revolution and, with a median age of approximately 24.5, these youth comprise a majority of the population in Libya. Youth have become increasingly frustrated with the new leadership and feel that they are ignoring their input; dismissing their demands and taking for granted their support. In Tripoli, as elsewhere, Libyan youth have demonstrated a sophisticated level of interest in how the transition occurs and what the end results will be. Considering that youth constitute a significant percentage of the population, there are many windows of opportunity for their empowerment and positive participation in this process. 

One such young group, Rights Without Borders has identified that raising awareness around the NTC’s transitional road map and generating an overall dialogue through information dissemination and outreach are needed in order for youth to engage in a more constructive dialogue on the next steps forward in the country.  Rights Without Borders is based in Misratah and was founded by nine active individuals concerned about the transition process in their country. These nine individuals are supporting the positive contribution that youth can make during this process and the overall support that youth can provide in the development of an emerging democracy. Their membership has grown and is they currently have 50 activists contributing to their overall objectives. 

Rights Without Boarders will build on the foundations set under TRIP003 and TRIP0021 and will expand the reach and distribution of the transitional roadmap.  They will take the transitional roadmap booklet developed under TRIP003 by H20 and through their TOT under TRIP0021 work to bring awareness to Misratah using the camera which will be used to develop videos around the campaign,  and will also provide still photographs of the activity for the group’s Facebook page and website.

H2O wrote and printed a booklet that outlined the transitional roadmap put forth by the NTC. The booklet depicts a 10-storey building built on the foundation of the revolution with each floor representing a critical milestone in the roadmap. This booklet was developed to ensure that youth and the general public better understood the transitional process and the next steps for the country. 

This activity assumes that by engaging youth and increasing their awareness on the country’s transition to a new government, they will be able to advance public expression and debate about the democratic transition.

Election Day in Libya will be on July 7, 2012 and is a historic moment in the transition process and the first election in over 42 years in Libya. With little to no experience in elections, proper monitoring and the visibility of elections monitors will be essential. This activity aims to ensure the integrity of the voting process by supporting 1,000 local observers with the necessary materials and equipment, such as vests, reporting forms, and phone cards, needed on the elections day throughout Libya’s seven (7) constituencies. Support for the legitimacy and integrity of the election will reinforce one of the fundamental principles of a democracy and lay a solid foundation as the country looks towards the constitution-writing process.

",Now See This! Observing a Historical Moment on Elections in Libya #2,"
With the completion of the electoral law and swearing in of the Election Commission in February 2012, Libya has taken another step forward on the road to democracy.  The High Commission for Elections announced that the country’s first free elections will be held on July 7th of this year. Supporting the observation of the upcoming national assembly elections is an essential step for democratic processes in Libya. Therefore, by supporting organizations who are training election observers, and by providing them with the materials and equipment needed, Libyans will have a visual marker and a stronger sense of confidences in the process when they go to the polling stations to cast their first ballot. 

Given that the majority of Libyans under age 60 years old have never participated in an election nor lived in a democratic society, there is a significant lack of knowledge about the role of election observation in a democratic system. In order to address this need, Rased was formed as a result of TRIP027 and its members held an intense series of trainings on elections observation. They provided training for local observers  in Tripoli, Misratah, the Nafousa Mountains, Sabha and Sirt in 7 constituencies throughout Libya.

Election Day will be a very visible and visual experience for Libyans. The identification and prominence of election monitors at the polling stations will reinforce the legitimacy and value of the election process. 

This activity aims to provide all the necessary materials and equipment to ensure that the voting process at different polling stations across the country is transparent and any witnessed violations will be reported and documented.

The observors in Rased participated under in training under TRIP027 and during the four workshops there were 82 participants and others trained who have joined Rased and come from Misratah, Tripoli, Sabha (250 from Tajemah Fazan observers is part of the rased network) Tarhuna, Zlitan, Khumes, ghiryan, Sabratah and tubreq from the east.

",The Next Step: Support for the Constitution Writing Process,"
On July 7, 2012, Libyans went to the polls in mass to vote in the first national elections in over 40 years. It is estimated that 1.8 million people out of the 2.7 registered came out to vote. Despite the federalism movement in the east, Benghazi had a turnout of 69%. 	Despite the postponement and lack of information dissemination before the elections, the EC pulled off a relatively smooth and successful election. The festive mood in various cities was demonstrated through impromptu gatherings. In Tripoli, thousands of people gathered throughout the day to celebrate the milestone their country had passed. Various others went to the graves of the martyrs to lay flowers. 

The M&E Manager stated that he was at Martyrs Square twice: first with a friend and then he returned to his house, packed up his family and went back, despite sitting in long traffic jams. “I did not expect the celebration. I really didn’t. ""To see people celebrate like that was incredible. People were giving free rides to the polling station. They put signs on their car and drove around to pick people up.” Under Qadhafi, he explained, no one celebrated. The M&E specialist shared that she couldn’t believe how organized the process was at the polling stations. “To see Libyans patiently waiting in line was already a new thing but more than that, people were not waiting to receive but to give. I was so proud to be Libyan.” 

While the road to the election was relatively smooth, there were several concerning instances especially in the East where federalists had overrun the HNEC office in Benghazi several days earlier ransacking it and created disruptions as several polling stations were burned in the East. In Kufra, where fighting between Zway and Tebou has created extreme tensions and polling was only finished several days after official election day. 

Now that Libya has elected a national constitutional parliament, charges with forming a commission to draft a new constitution is next. This commission will be composed of sixty (60) members, twenty (20) from the East, West and South. Once formed, the commission will have one hundred and twenty (120) days to draft the constitution and then present it to citizens for referendum.

The constitutional writing process will be challenging as Libyans look to enter a difficult phase of creating a new political system. This system will be shaped by the writing of a constitution and the balance of political power among the many groups that participated in the uprising and still hold sway in the country. Addressing diffuse feelings of resentment in many areas and getting Libyans and troubled regions fully vested in rule-bound democratic politics is certainly a wider challenge than just technical arrangements for drafting the constitution.

Support to the Libyan government and/or civil society and/or media outlets in developing detailed strategies for information dissemination, and dialogue on important issues and considerations pertaining to the constitutional drafting process and content and providing technical support in advocacy for civil society engagement in the constitutional drafting process will be key over the coming months and in the led-up to the referendum.

",Growing It Locally: Technical Assistance and Expertise in Libya,"
Transition programming is crucial to support the dramatic changes occurring in Libya in the weeks leading up to the congressional referendum and beyond. To ensure programming is impactful and well aligned with Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) objectives, targeted analytical scoping/conflict mapping is a theme which emerged from the July 2012 LTI Rolling Assessment.  The objective of this activity will be to identify local, technical assistance to conduct mapping and analytical work and thus a better understanding and enhanced engagement of particular communities to address underlying grievances. However, outreach, engagement, and participatory techniques are new to Libyans as are political processes. 

Similar to TRIP035, once technical experts are identified, they will focus on information gathering through existing resources, documentation of trends and evolving dynamics, building relationships with key actors, identification of potential partners,  and general dialogue that will be utilized in transition related programming. The technical expertise of individuals hired under this activity can range from geographic areas, most likely conflict prone portions of the country, to minority rights, history, identity issues, conflict mitigation and management, etc. 

One of the most notable areas of interest is the continued disenfranchisement of communities and associated grievances as it relates to (or becomes a contributing factor toward) border insecurity and/or creating pockets of more recruitable youth for extremists groups. Communities such as the Tebou, Twarge and Taureg, as well as Darna town are considered vulnerable to cooptation based on historical disenfranchisement.  Similarly, the Nafusa Mountains, home to a substantial Amazigh population, must also be kept in mind as a key demographic for engagement. 

Identification of target actors in the area - tribal, religious, cultural, minority, women, youth and governmental - may be considered under this activity, which will support hiring local-level resources to improve program targeting and subsequent impact.

In an effort to promote a peaceful democratic transition in Libya, this activity will strengthen the capacity of civil society and national and local media to guide the country’s transitional justice and reconciliation process. Libyan society continues to suffer from many conflicts and sensitivities that must be addressed before national reconciliation and inclusive governance can proceed. The Civil Society Coalition of Misratah, which proved itself as a well-networked and effective organization while under two previous election-related LTI grants, is looking to promote the issue of transitional justice on both national and local levels. In this activity, the grantee will bring together lawyers, sheiks, leaders of various brigades, human rights activists, local council representatives and media from throughout the country to be trained by the Public International Law and Policy Group as trainers on transitional justice. In an effort to bridge the gap between communities, the participants will include a diverse group of actors from conflict zones working to increase the dialogue between government officials, local leaders, and the relevant players in the NGO community. An international strategic communications expert will train a media team in skills of campaigning and strategic communication to enable them to effectively raise awareness on transitional justice.  Subsequently, those trained on issues of transitional justice will conduct 13 sub-workshops in nine locations around the country. Finally, the trainers and selected participants will gather with government and non-governmental actors, along with media, at a final conference in Tripoli. The participants will work together to develop a strategic framework for a transitional justice program that reflects the viewpoints of all targeted communities and stakeholders and will be presented to government officials as an expression of Libyan desires for the transitional justice process.

",Taking Transitional Justice Locally and Raising Voices Nationally,"
Following the Libyan revolution that began in February 2011, there is a clear desire and expectation within Libyan society for justice and accountability play a prominent role in the transition from dictatorship to democracy. In order to support an effective and just transition, Libya must address not only the human rights violations committed during the conflict in 2011 and subsequent events, but also those that took place during the 42 years of the Qaddafi regime.  It is widely agreed upon in Libyan society that maintaining peace and normalizing strained relations will be contingent upon an effective justice process for past crimes.  Without widespread belief that justice has been provided, Libya will not be able to move forward to create a unified and inclusive democratic state and a stable nation. 

The proposed grantee, the Civil Society Coalition of Misratah, was recently funded by USAID for training on elections (TRIP027) and observing the national Libyan elections (TRIP042).  Furthermore, the organization’s past experience in observation efforts for the Misratah local elections, their commitment to empowering local civil society, and their extensive network of civil society organizations across various sectors renders the Coalition the ideal partner for organizing transitional justice trainings. 
 
This grant will be implemented in three main phases: 1. Training upon of participants from selected target areas on transitional justice and training of media experts 2. Sub-workshops targeting conflict regions 3. Final conference of participants, trainers, and decision-making and government officials. 

In the first phase, an expert from the Public International Law & Policy Group (PILPG) transitional justice will conduct a training of local participants from selected geographic areas on transitional justice, including national reconciliation efforts, prosecution, Libyan law (article 17), an analysis of the current Libyan situation, conflict mitigation on the local level, and reparations. The trainees will be composed of a range of relevant actors, including NGO members working on transitional justice and national reconciliation, sheiks (religious actors), revolutionaries, local council representatives, leaders of militias, lawyers, and media experts.  
   
Following the first phase there will be a media communications training session. An international expert will design and facilitate the training which will be on strategic communication skills and campaign design for TV, radio, social media and printed materials. The media training will include 20 media experts from different media outlets national wide, ten of whom will have participated in the initial ToT training on transitional justice.

In the second phase, the Civil Society Coalition of Misratah will conduct a series of 13 smaller workshops in nine conflict zones locations: three in Misratah, two in Sebha, two in Benghazi, and one each in alBayda, Ejdabya, Zawya, Sebratha, Gharyan, and Zwara. In the weeks leading up to and during these workshops, a broad media campaign on transitional justice will be implemented by the trained media team. TV programs will be held on the local national channels, printed materials will be distributed by trainers and members of the Coalition of Misratah in all locations mentioned above and other cities throughout the country. A social media campaign will also be conducted at this time to raise awareness about the workshops and transitional justice in general.  

The objective of the 13 sub-workshops is to educate influential community actors throughout Libya on principles of transitional justice.  The workshop participants will then draft a framework of their desired approach to this important issue, including their demands to the government. In the final phase of this activity, participants from each of the 13 sub-workshops and all of the trainers will gather with members of the media, international and domestic NGOs, and government officials to discuss the outcomes of the sub-workshops and examine the differences and similarities between community demands.  Finally, the conference will produce a framework of shared demands to the government, reflecting the desires of Libyans across the country in regards to transitional justice.

This grant will build bridges between multiple actors involved in the transitional justice process, and increase the dialogue between government officials, local leaders, and the relevant players in the NGO/CSO community. The Civil Society Coalition of Misratah, in cooperation of PILPG and an international media expert, will build the capacity of participants of the workshops and trainings to advocate for their interests in the field of transitional justice. As a result, these actors will develop a strategic framework to implement a holistic transitional justice program that reflects the views of multiple stakeholders. If the plan is based on the best practices and lessons learned from the transitional justice field and all stakeholders feel a level of ownership over the process, then the implementation and execution of the transitional justice strategy will effectively and appropriately respond to Libyan people’s needs for justice and reconciliation

Engaging these youth in the political transition process will be essential to building a democratic Libya, assuring that they understand and are able to effectively advocate for their interests through political processes and non-violent action. In particular, this grant will provide 2.0v Media with material and technical support to produce a video campaign consisting of five videos on key transitional political processes, such as the constitution and its drafting process, political party systems, presidential powers, and civil society’s role in impacting politics.  In their last video campaign “Understand Me,” 2.0v Media proved their ability to produce high-quality short films that attract and educate youth audiences on some of the most relevant and talked-about political topics in Libya today.  Similarly, these new videos of “Understand Me 2” will target a youth audience, and will be aired on TV channels, 2.0v Media’s YouTube and Twitter accounts, and on their Facebook page through a Facebook advertisement.

The predominant sentiment in Libya is that citizens do not have access to simple and easy-to-digest information about transitional processes in general.  Now that the National Assembly has been elected, the next period poses an important step in the transitional process. With the election of the Constitutional Committee, the Libyan citizens need to understand more about the constitution and its importance to the country’s future. 

2.Ov media has experience in producing factual, entertaining, informative and easy to understand multi-media videos on civic education themes relevant to the Libyan context. 2.0v Media previously produced a campaign named “Understand Me”; this concept aims to produce the sequel for the campaign with new video ideas. 

In their videos, which are typically not longer than 4 minutes, 2.0v Media use simple colloquial Libyan Arabic. They have a small team that works on content research and development, in addition to production and video editing. In the past they got their content from the United Nations and from the Libyan National Transitional Commission (NTC). 

Overall the group has produced 4 videos in the first “Understand Me” campaign, and each episode received more than 3,000 views on YouTube. The topics of these episodes are “Fifth Column”, “Citizenship”, “Constitutional Proclamation”, and “Federalism.”   “Federalism” received more than 7,000 hits and created a heated debate between those for and against the federal system in Libya.

Many of the families have registered their missing with the Commission, however, a large number of the families still feel government distrust, especially families with missing people who were in support of the Gaddafi regime and whose missing may have been part of the old regime’s Katibas. There have been instances where people have gone to register their missing and have been asked for their ‘classification’; in other words, asked if the person is from the Thuwar or Gaddafi Katibas. This classification will stand in the way of the families of thousands of missing who were members of the Gaddafi regime.  

The FGM has been working with families of the missing in helping them file their cases with the Commission. The establishment of the Mafqood Support Center came as a result for the need for an independent body through which families can find solidarity support regardless of which side they were on during the revolution. The center has opened its doors to the families without establishing a registration process, to create a relationship of confidence and trust with the center first. Most of the families are struggling financially, and very often have lost the main providers (bread winners) for the family.

The Mafqood Support Center aims to be not only a sanctuary for families to seek solace and comfort, but also a platform from which the families can form a unified voice to tackle their legal and social issues through Libya’s first Missing Persons Family Support Group. This support group will hopefully play a role in addressing the collective issues faced by the families and in lobbying and campaigning of government, as well as submitting legislative suggestions. 

This activity aims to provide the Mafqood Support Center with a computer lab for the families of the missing. The computer lab will allow active families of the missing to have the opportunity to enhance technology integration skills and increase their computer utilization. The computers would also provide a medium for these families to learn computer IT skills, which will strengthen the families’ ability to coordinate, administer, organize and communicate with each other, other sister organizations, international aid agencies and governing bodies. 

This activity assumes that empowering the families of the missing to advocate for their rights using technology will help in national reconciliation. The families of both revolutionaries and Gaddafi supports will come together in one center to learn how to advocate for their rights locally and internationally. The families will have one common purpose: finding their missing loved one.

Social networking and the use of the internet continue to remain as dominant means by which youth search for information and engage in issues related to the ongoing political transition. As access to the internet and technology increases after the revolution, Libyan youth will need exposure to ways in which they can use these technologies for advocacy and networking of like-minded people. SHARE Beirut is a weekend-long public, free and non-commercial hybrid event blending an Internet culture and technology related daytime conference with dynamic cutting-edge music festival by night. It will bring together hundreds of passionate people, forward-thinkers, cultural creatives, activists and artists from Lebanon as all around the world for talks and parties in 72 hours of powerful gathering to share ideas, knowledge and creativity. This activity aims to support the travel for four individuals from two civil society organizations focused on youth to participate in SHARE Beirut and return to Libya to utilize skills, networking and ideas from the conference. One Alleqa, based in Tripoli, and another Libyan Organization for Development (LOD), based in Benghazi, have already been partners of the Libya Transition Initiative.

",From Libya to Lebanon and Back: SHARE Beirut - Internet Culture and Technology,"
SHARE Beirut is a weekend-long public, free and non-commercial hybrid event blending an Internet culture and technology related daytime conference with dynamic cutting-edge music festival by night. It will bring together hundreds of passionate people, forward-thinkers, cultural creatives, activists and artists from Lebanon as all around the world for talks and parties in 72 hours of powerful gathering to share ideas, knowledge and creativity.

It’s about understanding and celebrating Internet culture and all the aspects of open, decentralized and accessible forms of communication, exchange and creation. It’s about empowerment of individuals and networking of like-minded people. It's about setting the values and new standards that will prevent any kind of oppression, censorship and surveillance for future generations. It's about understanding alternative economic, cultural and educational models. It’s about Internet ecology and struggles to protect Internet as open and free territory for all of us. It's about energizing sub-cultural groups and praising diversity that these cultures are bringing. It's about promoting open access to software, hardware, information, knowledge, science, government, design and almost everything else that can be open. It’s about sharing. It’s about how to do it yourself. But mostly, it's about cats doing flips, birds flying over the moon and robots making biiips.

During the 3 days of the conference Beirut will become the world’s epicenter in exchanging progressive ideas and knowledge on Internet culture, society, technology, music and new media. The lectures and talks will be given by leading international stars in these fields, world-class bloggers and artists who will educate the audience on new forms of activism and approaches in using advanced technologies and the latest tools to create, influence and affect. Discussions will delve deep into the underground of the Internet subcultures and explore groups that fight for digital and human rights, free information flow and access, improving transparency, and protecting the privacy of fellow peers and residents. The event will be accompanied by an intensive music program, which will be simultaneously organized in several well-selected clubs and alternative venues in Beirut. The event will take place from 5th to 7th of October (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) 2012.

This activity will promote national unity by using Liberation Day to celebrate the shared value of “Freedom” and capture the accomplishments and hopes of the Libyan people. It important for civil society members to join their fellow citizens in acknowledging this momentous day.  As such, the H2O Team, one of the most recognizable and respected youth organizations in Libya, plans to use Liberation Day to continue their work of promoting national dialogue and mindfulness, having previously worked on several awareness raising campaigns on voter education and steps of the transition, as well as advocacy trainings for other NGOs.   In this activity, H2O Team will conduct a series of interviews with citizens in Tripoli on their views of freedom and its meaning for their lives and the future of Libya.  These interviews will take place in the days leading up to and on Liberation Day, which marks the one year anniversary of a “free Libya.”  On Liberation Day, the Team will conduct interviews and distribute T-shirts throughout Tripoli that promote thoughtful dialogue on the meaning of freedom.  The interviews will be compiled into a short film and distributed through social media and local TV channels with the aim of continuing the spirit of reflection and thoughtful consideration of freedom.

",Liberation Day Reflections: What Does Freedom Mean to You?,"
On October 23, 2011, Libya declared itself liberated from 42 years of Gaddafi’s oppressive rule.  As the one-year anniversary of this historic day approaches, citizens across Libya will reflect on the past year of transition, both the growing pains and the monumental accomplishments. Frustrations run high among Libyans, with the exuberance of the July elections fading as a new government has yet to be formed.  The past few weeks have also witnessed numerous protests over the absence of a unified security sector that has allowed ‘militias’ to run security in many parts of the country instead of the police and military.  

Liberation Day could be a time to focus on the failings of the transitional and new governments, or it could be an opportunity to highlight the accomplishments of the past year and hopes of the Libyan people for their country.  This activity aims to draw people to do the latter- to reflect on what “Freedom” means to citizens in their lives and for the future of Libya.  H2O Team will conduct a series of short, filmed interviews on the Tripoli streets in the days leading up to Liberation Day.  The Team will ask interviewees to describe their thoughts on freedom- its meaning, its responsibilities, its opportunities, etc.  They will share some footage in a “teaser” before October 23rd to encourage more conversations on these themes among the public. On October 23rd, the Team will dispatch across the city to distribute T-shirts that spark thoughtful dialogue on the meaning of freedom.  Some of the T-shirt recipients will also be interviewed by the Team, and all of the footage will be used to produce a short film to promote continued discussions in the weeks after Liberation Day.

The H2O Team seeks to encourage dialogue on the meaning of freedom.  H20 has worked on many projects that demonstrate the importance of youth contribution in the transition process.  As one of the most well-known NGOs in Libya, their involvement in Liberation Day is an important message to the public that they are in touch and responsive to the spirit of the streets.  They also have a large team of volunteers whose efforts will make a wide-scale activity requiring a lot of legwork possible.

This activity assumes that by capturing the voices of Libyans as they reflect on the meaning of freedom, H2O Team will be able to promote positive dialogue before, on, and after Liberation Day and encourage Libyans to reflect on the opportunities and great potential that can be realized through this new freedom.

As Libya prepares to draft its first constitution since 1969, it is a critical time for Libyan youth, a cornerstone to the revolution, to raise their voices and ensure that the drafting of the constitution is an inclusive political process. This activity will gather the viewpoints of 3,000 youth from throughout all of Libya on their hopes and desires for the new constitution.  This grant will provide materials and logistical support for the H2O Team, a widely-known youth advocacy group, to send a Campaign Team to conduct a road trip around the country, gathering data to be analyzed and compiled into a final report and video. The H2O team will go through a wide network of media, political, and international actors to share the results of their research on youth desires of the constitution with the Libyan public and the Constitutional Committee.

",DisTour: What Do Youth Want in the Constitution?,"
Though the formation of the new government has faced significant hurdles since elections were held in July 2012, the Libyan people look forward to the next milestone in the transition period: the drafting of a new constitution.  Not since 1969, when Gaddafi came to power, has Libya had a constitution, rendering this moment a highly significant political stepping stone in the minds and hearts of the Libyan people.

Though the Constitutional Assembly has yet to be established, civil society organizations have begun organizing conferences, workshops, and other events focused on issues around the constitution.  Young Libyan activists are playing a central role in shaping conversations on the constitution around the country, and it will be important for youth to ensure that their efforts impact the constitutional drafting process itself.  Before shaping a solid platform of policy recommendations, youth must understand each other’s viewpoints and strive to agree upon common goals they want to see realized in a new constitution.  

While youth represent approximately 60% of the Libyan population, they are at risk of being marginalized in political processes. It is critical that young people come together in advocating for their rights and form a more unified message to convey to the Constitution committee and other influential policy makers in the government.  This activity aims to gather a wide spectrum of youth views and opinions on the new constitution.  The proposed grantee, the H2O Team, has implemented many related activities funded by USAID/OTI and other donors, such as an outreach awareness raising project on the transitional “road map,” a voter education campaign, and trainings for civil society NGOs in Tripoli and Benghazi on successful outreach strategies.  In this activity, H2O will conduct a 30 day outreach campaign, during which they will travel throughout the country and survey 3,000 young people on their desires for the constitution.  While gathering the survey results, a team of data analyzers will work on compiling the findings in a final printed deliverable.  This deliverable will be shared with members of the Constitutional Committee and with the Libyan public.  Additionally, H2O will use footage of their road trip and interviews with some of the youth surveyed to raise awareness of the importance of youth activism around the constitution and provide another mechanism for youth opinions to be heard via national local media and social media.

This activity assumes that by gathering views on the constitution from youth throughout Libya, the grantee will be able to promote a variety of youth voices and encourage their participation in the constitutional drafting process, a key element of the democratic transition.

Fragility and conflict occupy spaces that are highly dynamic and uncertain, and bring with them problems that are irreducibly complex. Finding ways to get at the solutions to some of these problems is a pressing task for Libya. In Libya, understanding the realities of such places and identifying priorities requires a geographical focus on local areas and an analytical focus on the views of local people. This activity aims to support a baseline study in Benghazi, Tripoli, Sabha, Ghadames and Nafusa Mountains to provide a robust and ongoing index for key stakeholders (the Libyan public, Libyan government and the international community including the LTI program itself) seeking to measure stability and progress across a number of critical domains, including politics, economics, social and security over a six-month period in two-three month intervals. This activity will also support baseline information for the LTI program and help facilitate the development of area-specific profiles and needs and also serve as a means to measure and capture possible impacts.

",Feeling the Pulse: Perceptions on Stability and Progress,"
The Libyan Transition Initiative (LTI) supports the development of civil society in Libya and all efforts to build an inclusive and accountable democratic government that reflects the will and needs of the Libyan people. With the help of our partners within civil society and with guidance from international experts, LTI has overseen the launch of a pilot baseline study across Libya drawing on a series of extensive face-to-face questionnaires. 

The primary aim of the baseline study is to provide a robust and ongoing index for three key stakeholders (the Libyan public, Libyan government and the international community including the LTI program itself) seeking to measure stability and progress in Libya across a number of critical domains, including politics, economics, social and security. 

The study is being trialed in Benghazi and pending success will be rolled out across Tripoli and Sabha. A subsequent second phase will lead to research being conducted in several areas across the country and will be based upon government interest and/or needs of the program. The initial trial research in Benghazi took place over a two-week period and is almost finalized. This activity will support similar research efforts in Sabah, Tripoli, and Ghadames. Once analysis has concluded in the individual areas, research will continue to take place at two to three month intervals.

Methodology
In each of the five locations, 400 participants will be approached across 8-10 sub-locations (or Primary Sampling Units). This yielded a 95% confidence level with a +/- 5 confidence interval. Traditional random representative sampling techniques cannot be applied in Libya given local sensitivities and the lack of public experience in taking part in such endeavors. For example, random walks and Kish Grids are not suitable. Instead Secondary Sampling Units were selected based on local knowledge of popular transit points for people from that local area.

Participants will be chosen at random at each of these locations and answer an approximately 33-item questionnaire that was administer face-to-face by trained research assistants and will be overseen by a research project leader who will be the LTI Information and Reporting Officer. 

Questions will focus on security, local governance, social issues such as employment, inflation, services, and political perceptions. The questions will be tailored to a degree in the specific areas but also LTI will ensure consistency of primary core questions. 

Additionally, with the large youth population and fast-growing access and use of Internet, LTI is also going to consider the merits of conducting surveys online. In order to pilot the idea, LTI would open an account on Survey Monkey (http://www.surveymonkey.com/). This website supports Arabic and is a user-friendly way of building a questionnaire online and quickly. The online survey will allow the team to answer some extremely important questions. Firstly, it will show whether the Libyan online community provides the same answers as in face to face surveys. If they do, then we know that we can conduct surveys online in the future without suffering from accusations of poor data through inferior levels of 'representativeness'. Secondly, through getting online answers we can quickly get more answers to our questions - useful given the slowness with face-to-face teams are collecting data. Thirdly, the online survey allows us to get answers from respondents from more than just Benghazi, Tripoli and Sabah

In order to promote an inclusive and peaceful political transition process in Libya, this activity aims to better allow civil society and former revolutionary fighters, including women and minority representatives in southern Libya to participate in the upcoming constitutional drafting process. Discontent over regional and political marginalization, inter-group tensions, and lack of inclusive governance combine with illicit trade and illegal immigration, considerable arms supply and lack of government capacity to enforce security, to create an environment of increasing insecurity, frustrations and extremism. Both civil society and former revolutionary fighters are attempting to productively engage communities, seeing that the upcoming constitutional drafting process will be an important opportunity to take visible steps towards addressing underlying issues and grievances in the region. In particular, this grant will provide logistical and technical support to conduct a workshop for 50 civil society and former revolutionary fighters to learn the principles of constitutions and constitutional drafting processes in order to allow them to inform their communities, organize and prepare to actively participate in the drafting process.

",Engaging on the Constitution across Community Lines in the Fezzan,"
There is a general lack of awareness and understanding of the basic principles of constitutional drafting and processes in southern Libya.  The absence of substantial civic education efforts to inform citizens will impede the future political process in Libya; therefore a robust information dissemination effort is needed to fill this gap. This training is designated to increase participants’ capacity as NGO and thewar leaders to reach out to their communities and educate others on the basics of constitution-making and citizen participation in the process.

This activity aims to bring together leaders of nascent civil society in Sebha, Obari, Murzuq, and surrounding villages, and young men who identify as leaders of the thewar community, for training on the constitution and state-building.  Though by different means, these men and women have played an active role in previous stages of the transitional process and they are committed to continuing to advocate for positive changes in their communities.  However these groups need to be supported to help them develop adequate knowledge on the substance of the constitution and the constitution-drafting process.  Additionally, this workshop with provide an important venue for civil society, including minority and women’s groups, and the thewar to come together around one table to discuss together the constitutional drafting process and the ways in which they, as active citizens of the southern Fezzan, can engage in the constitutional process and promote the interests of their communities and a peaceful transition.

The Tajuma Fazzan Alwatani, as an active and leading member of the Union of Civil Society Organizations in Sebha, is a strong partner for this activity due to their wide reach and popularity in the Sebha region, and their strong performance on previous LTI grants.

By supporting this training, USAID/OTI will directly address the gap in these communities’ knowledge of the constitution and democratic principles more generally.  This will enhance the ability of these leaders to engage with their communities in the transitional process, thus supporting the development of an active and informed civil society.  These workshops will further assist the LTI team in identifying key actors and civil society organizations in the Fezzan region, and gaining a deeper understanding of the types of initiatives LTI could support there.

Libyan activists are playing a central role in shaping conversations on the constitution around the country, and it will be important to ensure that their efforts impact the constitutional drafting process itself.  Before shaping a solid platform of policy recommendations, Libyans must understand a host of viewpoints at all levels of society.   

As Libyans prepare for the opportunity to vote in the constitutional referendum, many communities, even some in the capital city of Tripoli, remain at risk of being poorly-informed on the drafting and ratification process. Although there are still uncertainties regarding the formation of the Constitutional Assembly, now is a critical time for Libyans to become well-informed and advocate for the basic rights they hope to see included in the new constitution, to convey their desires and expectations to the Constitutional Assembly and other influential policy makers.

This activity aims to assess the information gaps in regular Tripoli residents’ knowledge of the 
	constitution and to educate them through distributing flyers and airing PSAs on the constitution. 
	Although the proposed grantee, Step by Step, is a new organization, its members have been involved in
	 many related activities funded by USAID/OTI and other donors, such as humanitarian aid projects, the 
	Human Rights Film Festival, and civic education campaigns. Step by Step works in particularly close 
	collaboration with the Free Media Center, a former LTI grantee. The center was instrumental in Step by 
	Step's establishment, with some members belonging to both organizations and the center continues to 
	provide Step by Step with office space. Step by Step members were also involved in previous LTI 
	activity TRIP038, where they coordinated the media plan for the Human Rights Film Festival. Given their proven performance, and the strategic importance of their activities cameras, video editing software and other material supplies will be donate to Step by Step at the end of the activity to increase their capacity for continued efforts to support the political transition.  

In this activity, Step by Step will conduct an outreach campaign, during which they will survey 4,000 Libyans in nine underserved, low-income neighborhoods of Tripoli and greater Tripoli, where provision of government services is limited to determine what they know about the constitution. While polling respondents, the grantee will film interviews with them to produce ten PSA episodes, each lasting approximately 45 seconds. Step by Step will also develop and distribute flyers to address knowledge gaps identified through the surveys. Finally, they will produce a documentary film showcasing production and management of the campaign, and a team of data analysts will compile the findings in a final printed report to be shared with members of the Constitutional Committee and the Libyan public. The ultimate goal is to educate people in underserved communities in Tripoli on the importance of the constitution. 

This activity assumes that gathering and airing the views that Libyans in underserved Tripoli communities hold on the constitution will promote a variety of Libyan voices and encourage Libyans to learn about the constitution and encourage people to participate in the constitutional drafting process, a key element of the democratic transition.

",Creating the Space for Debate: Supporting a Women’s Center in Yefren,"
Since the liberation of the country in August 2011, severe tensions have occurred during the transition process. Many Libyans do not understand the basic vocabulary on the fundamentals of democracy, constitution making and elections. This lack of understanding inhibits effective and productive dialogue on transitional issues that are currently ongoing in the country. Also by not understanding these issues, the population, especially women and civil society, are constrained in their contributions and their ability to effectively participate in the process is weakened.

During the revolution, many civil society organizations emerged to meet the humanitarian needs that were of priority at that time. Tiwatriwin, which in Tamazight (Amazigh language of the Nafusa Mountains) means prayers, was one of those who had volunteered to help the refugees on the Libyan-Tunisian borders. Tiwatriwin provided essential assistance including health care, food, and shelter. After the revolution and as civil society has embarked on more transition-related programming, Tiwatriwin has changed their focus from humanitarian aid to working and advocating for women rights issues in Yefren and wants to be one of the main sources of information for women in the Nafusa Mountains. In addition, Tiwatriwin wants to develop and improve women’s capacity in IT skills, disseminate information on and raise awareness about political and social changes during the transitional period. 

Although Yefren locates at the Nafusa Mountain and close to Tripoli, it lacks internet service and any electronic information for ongoing activities on the transitional period. Moreover, women who live in Yefren and surrounding towns, have no access to the internet or a place to meet and learn about constitution, transitional justice and any other topic relates to the transitional period. Furthermore, Nafusa Mountain considered being culturally, a conservative community. Thus it is hard for women to set and engage in a public internet cafes. By providing such service to Tiwatriwin center will help women to engage effectively in the transitional process.   

Tiwatriwin has engaged in many different activities and received international assistance to create a women’s center and for the provision of all the essential utilities and basic furniture. Furthermore, some members of the organization have received an international training in Sweden and UK on human rights and woman’s rights issues. The center has two classrooms, a kitchen, a library, a meeting room and a spacious area to create a computer lab. Tiwatriwin has English and Tamazight language classes for women and has been used as platform for women to meet and discuss political and social issues. Currently, the local council supports the center with paying for the rent and utilities for the building that houses the center. This is not a government but a private building.

The Tiwatriwin center is located in Yefren in the Nafusa Mountains, just west of Tripoli. The Nafusa Mountain region is composed of several small cities and numerous villages, the largest of which include Gharyan, Yefren, Jadu, Kabaw, Zintan, Al-Qawalish, and Nalut. While the Nafusa Mountains have not witnessed the extent of clashes that currently plague other areas of the country, there are long outstanding grievances between different tribes as well as friction between pro- and anti-Qadhafi factions that threaten long-term stability. The region is home to most of Libya’s Amazigh peoples, who were marginalized under the Qadhafi regime and are now struggling to ensure that their rights and recognition are protected in the constitution and new government’s legislation. Yefren, and the nearby village of Ghala, is one of the larger population hubs in the Nafusa Mountains, and is less focused on Amazigh issues as much as general security and political situation in Nafusa region as a whole.


This activity aims to provide Tiwatriwin women’s center with a computer lab for the women. The computer lab will allow women to have the opportunity to enhance IT skills and increase their computer utilization. The computers would also provide a medium for women to learn computer IT skills, which will strengthen their connections with other local and international civil society. Moreover, it would widen their knowledge and capacity on democracy, constitutional and women rights issues. 

LTI plans to promote sustainabilty of the center by hiring an STTA who will work with the grantee to develop a business model to maintain internet connection costs. Since LTI hopes to replicate this civil society internet center model in multiple areas, this technical expertise is planned to be hired through a separate STTA rather than as a budget line for this individual grant. 

The assumption behind this activity is that increased access to information and skills will contribute to women playing a more active role in the transitional processes. By empowering women to learn about the constitution, women’s rights, reconciliation, transitional justice and other related transition issues through IT and the center, this will facilitate discussions and dialogue around the constitution drafting period. The center will function as a medium for women to gather and learn about political issues and the center will be accessible for women who live in Yefren and in the neighboring areas of the Nafusa Mountains.

",Supporting Information Dissemination & Virtual Discourse - Libya Herald Online,"
Since the liberation of the country in August 2011, severe tensions have occurred during the transition process. While the revolution opened Libya’s political space, after 42 years of repression, Libyans have little experience with political engagement and there is a lingering legacy of alienation. Many Libyans do not understand the basic vocabulary on the fundamentals of democracy, constitution making and elections. This lack of understanding inhibits effective and productive dialogue on transitional issues that are currently ongoing in the country. Also by not understanding these issues, the population is constrained in their contributions and its’ ability to effectively participate in the process is weakened.

The Libyan Herald is a venture between a number of Libyans and the occasional non-Libyan. The on-line edition went live on 17 February, 2012 – the first anniversary of the Libyan Revolution. Currently, it is only an online resource and aims to cover every aspect of society in Libya: politics, business, sport, culture, education, construction and infrastructure, health issues, social stories, opinions, jobs, tenders, and so forth. 

Quite often the Libyan Herald articles are some of the most timely and relevant news in Libya and is widely read by persons both in and outside Libya. On Libyan Herald’s first year anniversary, 17 February, the latest figures show that during the last 12 months, they have had over 1.7 million visits, 36 million page views AND 76 million hits. They are also Goggle News’ most quoted source on Libya.

They have a very diversified audience of readers and irrespective of the information being in English, those in Libya top the list of visitors (over 56,000) followed by the United States (23,070) and UK (19,628). 71% of the visitors are returning with an average of three pages being browsed per visit. Many Libyan Facebook groups and users share Libyan Herald articles that often generate dialogue on varying topics including security, transitional justice, the GNC, and government in general. Additionally, articles are often cited through Twitter feeds. 

This activity aims to increase access to information and expand forums for public discourse by facilitating national and local media to provide improved coverage of the transition. This grant will provide equipment support to the Libyan Herald as they look to grow. They will be adding two additional interns/journalists who will receive day-to-day training and mentoring over the course of six months. Additionally, MEPI is sponsoring these additional journalist interns, but not providing any hardware support. LTI’s grant would be filling a critical gap and enable these journalist to rapidly contribute to reporting on the transition and current affairs in Libya. 

Currently, the Libyan Herald is co-located with Tripolis which is a Libyan Arabic newspaper. Often, the paper will translate Libyan Herald articles for their newspaper and there is extensive coordination and collaboration between the two groups. One desktop and one laptop will be provided to this organization through this grant. 
 
The assumption behind this activity is that increased access to information will contribute to Libyans playing a more active role in the transitional processes. By supporting the Libyan Herald in contributing to the dissemination of quality information, this will facilitate discussions and dialogue around the constitution drafting and transition period.

The pace of the debate around the constitution, state structures, and the referendum is increasing. Considering the current tensions and frustrations with the transitional process, there is the need to have a flexible, responsive mechanism that allows the project to quickly disseminate information. These documents and materials will help to provide important information resources to the existing partners, new civil society organizations, government representatives and/or the public at large.

",Rapid Information Dissemination during the Drafting of the Constitution,"
In September 2011, Libya’s Transitional National Council released a Constitutional Charter for the Transitional Stage of the country’s democratic development, and in July 2012 Libya successfully held its first democratic elections in more than four decades. The 200 members of the General National Congress that was consequently appointed were charged with appointing the Constitution-Drafting Committee to guide Libya through the constitutional-development process, although debate is ongoing as to whether the committee should be appointed or elected.

The manner of selecting committee members is but one of the uncertainties Libya is faced with regarding the constitution drafting process. Decisions are yet to be made regarding the role the public will play in this crucial process prior to the planned national referendum that will see a draft constitution adopted or rejected. The timeline for the constitution’s development is also uncertain, as is the extent to which the new constitution will incorporate elements of its pre-Qadhafi 1951 predecessor.

With so much uncertainty regarding the process by which the constitution will be developed, let alone its content, there is a need for factual, unbiased information presented in a readily accessible manner. This need is particularly great as tensions are already rising over key constitutional issues, such as federalism and control of state oil reserves. Providing information about the constitution-drafting process and various mechanisms for engagement will both promote stability during this crucial period in Libya’s political transition and provide communities with information needed to avail themselves of engagement mechanisms when these are presented as the constitution-drafting process evolves.

LTI has supported several trainings of civil society and former revolutionary fighters from districts in the southern and eastern parts of Libya on the constitution and subsequent processes in the lead-up to the referendum. The participants were able to obtain information on the constitution and develop a basic skills set in which they can train and/or conduct outreach campaigns in their communities. As a next step, several organizations in each of these areas will begin their own outreach and information dissemination campaigns. 

With such uncertainty to the processes and timeline of the drafting process, the program may be required to respond quickly and effectively to address key gaps in information and it is possible that potential partners will have not been identified at the time however the development of the content in advance will be key to ensuring that this information is delivered in a timely manner. 

This activity aims to support the development, provision, and/or delivery of existing or new information, eductation and communication (IEC) materials on Libya’s constitution processes in addition to providing a flexible information dissemination mechanism. Subject matter can range from the basic vocabulary around the constitution and processes for the drafting phase to the role of civil society in the consultation process to the referendum in addition to international materials on constitution making, democracy, and restructuring of the state. This activity is similar to a previous DDGS (TRIP020) that was used to procure IEC materal for the election.

Subsequently, other grants may be cleared to implement the dissemination of the materials after selection of appropriate grantees. Similarly, existing networks will also be utilized to disseminate the materials through previous, current, or potential grantees.

USAID/OTI assumes that supporting information dissemination during the constitution writing stage of the transition will help in creating an environment for public dialogue and thereby promote public participation in Libya’s transition to democracy.

This grant aims to empower both civil society organizations (CSOs) and the general public in Murzuq to acquire information and engage in peaceful and constructive dialogue about Libya's transition by creating a computer center with internet access. This activity will establish a computer room with fifteen desktop computers, VSAT equipment, and a year’s internet subscription at Sons of the Desert, a local CSO, building. The center is located in the city of Murzuq, a large population hub in an isolated area of the South that is increasingly becoming a home to the traditionally marginalized Tebu community. Sons of the Desert will manage the center and provide computer skills training and ensure that local CSOs have suitable space to connect with people, communicate about issues, and participate in the political process.

",Opening up the South: Bringing IT to Murzuq,"
Since the liberation of the country in October of 2011, significant tensions and clashes have occurred in the South during the transition process. While the revolution opened Libya’s political space, after 42 years of repression, Libyans have little experience with political engagement and there is a lingering legacy of alienation. Many Libyans have not been equipped with the basic knowledge on the fundamentals of democracy, constitution-making and elections. This lack of understanding inhibits effective and productive dialogue on transitional issues that are currently ongoing in the country. Because of the absence of civic education, the population, especially that of the southern region, is constrained in their contributions and their ability to effectively participate in the process is weakened.

While the Internet is very popular in Libya as a means for obtaining information, it is mostly limited to the coastal areas in addition to areas that were popular with tourists pre-revolution (e.g. Ghadames). As one travels into Nafusa Mountains or further south, access to the Internet becomes very limited (e.g. Sabha/Obari) to non-existent (e.g. Murzuq/Ghat/Kufra).

The southern city of Murzuq is located on the northern edge of the Murzuq Great Dunes Desert, lying about 100 miles from Sabha.  It has an estimated population of 45,000 of mixed racial backgrounds (Tebu, Arab, Twareg) and is considered one of the main cities of the Libyan south.  Sons of the Desert, the proposed grantee, was one of the first NGOs to be established in Murzuq after the end of the war and is composed of a dynamic, motivated group of Murzuq Tebu youth. Since the founding of the organization they have taken the leading role in responding to the post-war situation and have been active in mitigating conflict within the community with the help of other Murzuq-based NGOs. As identity and citizenship issues are contentious in the south, Murzuq is a very mixed and multi-faceted town where ethnic tensions do exist. Additionally, due to lack of internet and mainstream media, the population lacks access to key information around the ongoing transition process in Libya.  

This activity is aimed at the implementation of a computer center, composed of fifteen desktop computers, with VSAT broadband Internet connection. It is designed to create a suitable space where both CSOs and the general population of Murzuq will be able to access and share information about the transition, local and national news, among other things. Currently, Sons of the Desert occupies a medium sized building located near the city center, along with a host of other CSOs – Aman, Almeezan, and the Tebu Council of Elders which makes these organizations direct beneficiaries of the proposed activity as well.

Residents of Murzuq and surrounding towns lack Internet access as well as a place to meet and learn about constitutional processes, transitional justice and any other topic related to civic education and the transitional period. By providing a computer center to the Sons of the Desert office building, it will create a space that will assist key local partners to develop skills and tools necessary to mobilize advocacy networks, meaningfully engage in political processes, and monitor the transition’s progress with a particular focus on traditionally marginalized constituencies (e.g. women, youth, minority groups, and people living in remote areas of the southern regions).

The Libya Transition Initiative project plans to promote sustainability of the center by hiring an STTA who will work with the grantee to develop a business model to maintain internet connection costs. Since LTI hopes to replicate this type of civil society Internet center in multiple areas, this technical expert is planned to be hired through a separate STTA grant rather than as a budget line for this individual grant. 

The assumption behind this activity is that increased access to information and skill-building activities will contribute to Libyans playing a more active role in the transitional processes. By empowering the public to learn about the constitution, human rights, reconciliation, transitional justice and other related transition issues through IT and the center, this will facilitate discussions and dialogue around the constitution drafting period. The center will function as a medium for people to gather and learn about political issues and it will be accessible to the general population of Murzuq.

",Visualizing the Transition: Short-Term Mapping Support in Libya,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

Quality mapping products are a necessary program tool that enables LTI to make informed decisions in this rapidly evolving and complex operating environment. The ability to visualize activities and analysis is also critical in helping LTI report to a wide array of stakeholders. However, quality GIS data sources are difficult to obtain and GIS capacity in Libya is relatively low. LTI had a GIS specialist from USAID/OTI’s Geographic Information Unit (GIU) come to Libya in February/March 2013 to provide program mapping support. Subsequently, LTI conducted a Strategy Review Session (SRS) in November, underwent a Program Performance Review (PPR) in December, and hosted an M&E specialist in January. Now, there is a need to ensure that LTI’s mapping products and processes are in synch with these recent strategy and program developments. 

This activity will enable the GIU’s GIS specialist to return for a three - four week follow-up visit. Specially, this grant will primarily provide essential logistical and operational support for the trip, such as lodging and transportation expenses. The GIS specialist will focus on supporting a number of mapping deliverables, including improved GIS data management and mapping of: (1) neighborhoods within cities that are LTI geographic focal points (e.g. Tripoli, Benghazi, Sabha, and Kufra); (2) beneficiaries who participate in LTI activities; (3) survey data from activities such as TRIP051, TRIP052, and TRIP054; and (4) conflict incident mapping. The specialist will also meet with local partners to identify data sources and possible program support opportunities. Lastly, the specialist will work with LTI local staff to develop in-house capacity for sustainable program mapping support. 

The outputs of this activity will directly feed into LTI’s decision making, reporting, and monitoring and evaluation. The mapping specialist will be able to engage with key government ministries, such as the Ministry for Local Government (MoLG), to see how LTI’s mapping initiatives could potentially be leveraged to support ongoing technical and policy processes. The specialist will also help LTI evaluate new ideas that involve GIS, such as support for conflict early warning systems. The activity assumes that the GIS specialist will be able to accumulate a sufficient amount of reliable data in order to produce the anticipated deliverables.

To provide rapid support to an emerging local governance cluster, this STTA will spend four weeks developing a detailed scope of work for a longer-term local government advisor and identifying ideas for catalytic small grants that can be rapidly rolled out. The advisor will be based in Tripoli to liaise with national partners, but may also visit local councils outside of the capital as need arises. The short-term advisor will coordinate closely with the Ministry of Local Government (MoLG) and international stakeholders to ensure that outputs are aligned with national strategy and do not duplicate other donor initiatives.

",Looking More Closely at Local Government: Technical Assistance,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

The creation of responsive, representative local government institutions is a critical component of Libya’s transition. Municipal government is the primary link between people and the state, and these institutions were crippled and corrupted by central control during Qadhafi’s regime. The Transitional National Council passed Law No 59/ 2012 on Local Administration System in June 2012, but the law has not yet been implemented. A GNC committee is currently drafting bylaws and establishing administrative zones, which will then activate the law, enable municipal and provincial elections, and create a new political landscape overseen by the Ministry of Local Government (MoLG).   Elected and unelected local councils currently fill the legal vacuum, but their effectiveness has been constrained by weak capacity, limited resources, and unclear functions. The slow pace and uneven performance of local government is creating a crisis of confidence in the transition and opening space for opportunistic spoilers to manipulate grievances. By identifying emerging leaders and piloting successful models, the Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) can play a catalytic role at a local level in bolstering the credibility of the new government over the coming critical months and laying a foundation for improved governance over the longer term.

This activity will provide a short-term STTA to advance LTI’s emerging local governance strategic objective. LTI ultimately plans to recruit a longer-term local government STTA. However, given the delay in activating local government laws and the immediate need to address the poor perception and performance of existing local government bodies, this short-term advisor will help lay essential groundwork for LTI’s local government engagement strategy by mapping out the major lines of need and effort going forward.  Specifically, the STTA will spend three weeks in Libya to: (1) develop and draft a scope of work for a longer-term local government STTA; (2) identify immediate opportunities for catalytic small grants; (3) coordinate with other stakeholders to ensure strategic alignment and avoid program duplication; and (4) provide technical input into LTI’s local government cluster strategy. 

As a result of this STTA, LTI will be well informed and poised to support the MoLG’s local government vision as the legislative framework is implemented. Based in Tripoli, this STTA will work closely with a local government technical advisor embedded in the Benghazi Local Council under BENG017 to promote linkages between national and local-level actors. Additionally, collaboration between these two STTAs may generate new ideas on how different local councils can share lessons learned and best practices to promote cross-fertilization at a municipal level. This activity assumes that the MoLG will continue to make progress in activating local administration legislation and there will be increasing opportunity to support local government partners as Libya’s political transition moves forward.

This activity aims to support inclusive participation by an informed public in Libya’s political transition by creating a rapid-response mechanism to fund outreach and education activities on the issue of state structures. The DDGS will support approximately four public symposiums and workshops that will increase understanding, create opportunities for dialogue, and disseminate printed materials on the options for creating and allocating authority among state institutions. The symposiums and workshops will be held throughout the country, and the DDGS will give flexibility to focus on peripheral areas where decentralization is a central issue but where there either may not be established grantees or the objective of inclusivity is best obtained by not having a single local organization as grantee. An international technical expert will work in close partnership with local partners to support civil society participation on a contentious transition topic that is critical to both constitution development and the establishment of local government institutions.

",Supporting Workshops on Governance Structures and Institutions,"
In September 2011, Libya’s Transitional National Council released a Constitutional Charter for the Transitional State that established the milestones in a transitional process, include the drafting of a new constitution and the eventual election of a new and permanent legislature. In July 2012, and pursuant to the Constitutional Charter, Libya successfully held its first democratic elections in more than four decades and elected a 200-member General National Congress (GNC).  

The original Constitutional Charter tasked the elected GNC with appointing a 60-person constitutional drafting committee.  Political negotiations with Eastern political forces, however, led to an amendment to the Charter immediately prior to the election July that provides for a popularly elected drafting committee.  While the GNC was unable to meet the original deadline to form the constitutional committee within 30 days of its first sitting on August 8, 2012, it voted on February 6 to endorse the election of the committee consistent with the July amendment.  The decision of the GNC was taken amid growing uncertainty about the transitional timeline and increasingly vocal criticism of the national government’s inability to manage security, provide services, and empower local government institutions.  

The protracted discussions on the selection or election of the constitutional committee had  become a proxy for the ongoing debate over the level of decentralization to local and regional authorities.  The GNC has been strongly criticized by some for delaying progress on the implementation of the Law on Local Administration System (Law 59/2012), which has prevented Local Councils from taking an active role in service delivery and cast further doubt on the national government’s commitment to a genuine transfer of authority to local institutions.  “Pro-decentralization” sentiment that was historically centered in the Eastern region of Cyrenaica has now emerged in Southern parts of the country, and this growing frustration has spurned wider calls for a “federal” state which have the potential to widen political divisions in the country.    

Addressing these feelings of resentment in many areas and getting troubled regions fully vested in rule-bound democratic politics is a more difficult task than just technical arrangements for drafting the constitution. The population must understand and buy-in to the overall governance structures that are established both in the constitution and in the wider legislative framework. Thus, raising awareness on the options for governance structures and mechanisms for regional and local empowerment, in addition to the constitutional process, is essential.  

This activity aims to support a rapid response fund for approximately three months to provide a technical expert and/or Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) local partners the resources needed to facilitate the implementation of public symposiums and workshops that strive to enhance an inclusive and well informed dialogue regarding governance structures and models for devolution of authority to regional and local governments.  These workshops and symposiums would likely occur in tandem, subject to availability of the trainer and local partners who will assist in organizing the events. Examples of subject areas to be covered under this activity include:
  
1)	 Constitutional Principles & Libyan Constitutional Process
2) 	State Structures & Governance (National, Regional and Local)
3) 	Models for Allocation of Authority, State Practice and Advantages/Disadvantages of these Models
4)	 Application of models for Allocation of Authority to Libyan context

An international trainer will provide foundational knowledge on these subjects and basic information material will be distributed for further dissemination.  Through this activity, participants of the workshops and symposiums will receive a better understanding of a complex, contentious, and critical transition issue, and hopefully apply this knowledge to conduct more contextualized outreach activities on state structure in their community, either supported by LTI or on their own. 

The DDGS mechanism allows for a flexible, adaptable approach to spreading information on this key transition issue.  As the decision to hold elections prolongs the overall constitution development process, it will also likely accelerate the debate about substantive issues such as decentralization because this will be the type of topic that will form the basis of candidate platforms and will be of most interest to key constituencies. Therefore, the flexible DDGS mechanism is necessary to be responsive to the rapidly evolving transition roadmap and ensure that LTI is positioned to provide the timely support necessary for civil society to effectively feed into these upcoming events.

",Nissa Qadimat: Building a Network and Unified Voice for Women’s Rights,"
Human rights in Libya were systematically denied by the political system of the Gaddafi regime, and women were subject to a host of additional gender-specific human rights violations. Family, penal, and citizenship laws in Libya relegate women to a subordinate legal status compared to their male counterparts. After Libya signed the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 2004, hope was restored amongst Libyan women activists; however the rights enshrined in CEDAW were never translated into action or legislation. 

During the revolution, women participated and played a critical role alongside men. They cooked for fighters on the front lines and sewed flags; they smuggled weapons, medical supplies, cash, food and information and initiated NGOs, whilst witnessing the loss of husbands, fathers, brothers and sons in the name of freedom.  As of result of their efforts, Libyan women felt as if the door to freedom had finally opened, yet now they find themselves in post-revolutionary Libya where a women’s role within a new society and political sphere has not lived up to their expectations.   Many women are determined to gain the rights that they were denied under the former regime and women’s rights activities and dialogue has increased recently towards this end. 

Aicha Al-Megrebe is a Libyan poet and writer from eastern Libya who lives in Tripoli and lectures in Zaituna University in Tarhouna.  She is the founder of Fa’al Organization for Human Development, which is the organizing body for this activity.  Personally, she has been the victim of several aggressive attempts to silence her voice as a women’s rights activist, but has remained unwaveringly determined to fight for the rights of women in Libya and to strengthen a network of fellow activists towards these aims. As a regular participant in conferences and activities throughout the region, Al-Megrebe connected with many women who joined her in forming the “Nissa Qadimat” movement for women’s empowerment.  The founders of this movement include Laila Nassimi from Morocco, Majeda Dahri from Tunis, Salma Alwali from Mauritania, and Samah Abou Aloula from Egypt.  As they each struggle in their home countries in the fight for women’s equality, Al-Megrebe aspires to exchange experiences with those ladies and learn from them as the women’s rights movements in other North African countries have been historically more advanced and active than the movement in Libya. She dreams to create a nationwide network of women’s rights advocates that can exchange lessons learned with other North African activists.  

In this vein, Fa’al Organization is establishing the Libyan Chapter of Nissa Qadimat, which will operate as an independent organization after this activity.  For over six months, women from Tripoli, Sabha, Jebel Nafusa, and Benghazi have been collaborating in person and through social media to share ideas and discuss pressing issues facing women today.  This group now looks to come together to formally launch their Nissa Qadimat network.

Few women in Libya have knowledge or experience in the field of human rights and the importance of advocating and protecting those rights in legislation or the constitution. Despite their active participation in the revolution, they lack the necessary organizational capacity to speak as one voice in the political process. A number of women’s organizations and CSOs exist, but most are under-developed, under-resourced and in need of support to play a leading role in Libya’s transition to a strong democracy.  Furthermore, these women’s organizations are disjointed, and not very well networked with one another, limiting their effectiveness and ability to meaningfully participate and contribute to the policy-making process.  

Women-led organizations can play a leading role in creating a more participatory, prosperous, and democratic society if provided the skills, knowledge, support and opportunity to actively participate as a unified force in the political process.  With this aim in mind, this activity will support a two-day national conference that focuses on building the capacity of women-led civil society organizations to effectively participate in advocating for their rights and participating in the political sphere. The conference will educate participants about the importance of women rights in new Libya, allowing them to learn from each other and from international activists who will speak about how they have fought for these rights. In the workshops following the conference, Libyan activists will receive technical assistance and guidance from trainers in advocacy campaigns and women’s rights in the constitution. 

This activity assumes that women’s participation in Libya’s transition is essential to the success and the sustainability of a democratic Libya and the well-being of all Libyans. This activity also assumes that while women in Libya have high levels of potential and capacity, it is important that their efforts be coordinated and focused.

","Promoting Change: Advocacy Skills Training in Tripoli, Benghazi and Sabha","
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

One of the LTI’s main strategic objectives is to promote inclusive participation by an informed public in the transition’s main milestones, with a particular focus on traditionally marginalized constituencies (e.g. women, youth, minority groups, and the southern regions). LTI has supported numerous activities aimed at assisting key local partners to develop skills and tools necessary to mobilize advocacy networks, meaningfully engage in political processes, and monitor the transition’s progress. 

Beyond Reform and Development International (BRDI) is a Lebanon-based consulting firm and social business specialized in public management reform, policy innovation and people development. BRDI currently operates in twelve Arab countries, and BRDI consultants are highly familiar with USAID and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI). Three board members and consultants helped create and implement the advocacy component of OTI’s Lebanon Civic Initiative, and have also provided technical assistance to the OTI Tunis and OTI Yemen teams. BRDI has also worked with civil society in Libya, most recently on UNDP’s “Open Dialogue for Libya’s New Constitution,” which held local dialogues across the nation on constitutional development. 

This grant will provide LTI partners and staff with in-depth knowledge of advocacy and campaigning skills. BRDI will first conduct a rapid capacity needs assessment so they can adapt and tailor their established curriculum to the needs of Libyan civil society and the evolving context of Libya’s transition. BRDI will then hold four three-day training sessions in Tripoli, Benghazi, and Sabha with select past and prospective LTI partners on core advocacy concepts and tools. Some LTI staff will be attending trainings in order to enable them to more effectively work with civil society partners to design and develop advocacy campaign grants. BRDI will also produce a customized “Advocacy Toolkit” that will distill major concepts, provide practical guidance on building advocacy campaigns, and summarize lessons learned and best practices from Lebanon and other countries. 

The training and toolkit will build on LTI’s foundation of past experience with local organizations, incorporate lessons learned, and assist civil society to take the next step in participating in Libya’s political transition. This initiative seeks to empower civil society to be more effective partners for LTI’s next round of activities – such as information dissemination campaigns around the constitution and local government, internet centers as platform for public engagement in the political process, and activities that strengthen moderate voices in civil society to be catalysts for progressive change. 

This activity assumes that promoting engagement of civil society will support a credible and stable transition that reinforces national unity and results in representative, accountable institutions.

",Bringing the Constitution to Campus: Civic Education for Students in Sabha,"
In September 2011, Libya’s Transitional National Council released a Constitutional Charter for the Transitional Stage of the country’s democratic development and in July 2012 Libya successfully held its first democratic elections in more than four decades. The 200 members of the General National Congress that was consequently appointed were charged with appointing the Constitution-Drafting Committee to guide Libya through the constitutional-development process.

Libya is faced with many uncertainties regarding the constitution drafting process. Decisions are yet to be made regarding the role the public will play in this crucial process prior to the planned national referendum that will see a draft constitution adopted or rejected. The timeline for the constitution’s development is also uncertain, as is the extent to which the new constitution will incorporate elements of its pre-Gaddafi 1951 predecessor. With so much uncertainty regarding the process by which the constitution will be developed, let alone its content, there is a need for factual, unbiased information presented in a readily accessible manner. This need is particularly great in southern Libya, where tensions are already rising over key constitutional issues, such as federalism and control of state natural resources. Providing information about the constitution-drafting process and various mechanisms for engagement will both promote stability during this crucial period in Libya’s political transition and provide communities with information needed to avail themselves of engagement mechanisms when these are presented as the constitution-drafting process develops.

Under TRIP053, the Libya Transition Initiative supported the training of 50 civil society members, many of whom are members of the Coalition, and former revolutionary fighters from key districts in the South on the substance of the constitution and subsequent processes in the lead-up to the referendum. The participants were able to receive information on the constitution and develop a basic skills set with which they can train others and/or conduct outreach campaigns in their communities.  This provided an opportunity for Libyans to own these skills and promote this key transitional process, thus contributing to the sustainability of democracy education.

With this activity, LTI looks to take the knowledge and skills learned from this training one step further. There is a gap in providing simple and basic information on constitutional concepts and process, and making such information accessible to Sabha, and indirectly to neighboring districts such as Murzuq, Obari, Ghat, and Brak.

The Coalition of Civil Society Organizations in Sabha and its member CSOs (Tajuma Fazan, Ansam Alhoria, and the Women’s Coalition are some of the most active members) is well-placed to engage in civic education and awareness campaigns in Sabha, given their resources and wide and diverse networks, in addition to past donor experience. Through this activity, the coalition is planning an intensive 2-day workshop on the constitution for about 50 of its members, to be divided afterwards into small groups that will lead outreach campaigns, along with preparation and dissemination of information targeted at university and high school students.  This activity will also indirectly deliver valuable information through the students to their families at home.

This activity assumes that by engaging university and high school students and other community members, increasing their awareness of the constitution-drafting process and providing them with opportunities to engage with communities, they will be able to advance public understanding of constitutional development processes and engagement opportunities, transfer knowledge to the otherwise neglected or marginalized sectors of the community, and thereby promote public participation in Libya’s transition to democracy.

",Shining the Spotlight on Key Issues and Informing the Debate thru Video,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

There are signs that the slow pace of Libya’s transition is set to speed up in coming months. On February 7, the GNC announced that a constituent assembly responsible for drafting a new constitution would be popularly elected rather than appointed. While no timetable for drafting the election law or holding elections has yet been announced, it is likely that the decision to hold elections will accelerate the debate around substantive and contentious issues since these will form the basis of candidate’s campaign platforms. After a period of prolonged stagnation, the GNC is increasingly debating important legislation on transitional justice, local government, and political exclusion. The GNC passed an approximately $67 BN LYD budget on March 19, and the government also signed a key power supply contract in March. Additionally, the government is taking active steps to address declining security, including dismantling illegal militias and prioritizing new border security initiatives. However, the ability of civil society to effectively engage in the expanding political space is remains constrained by ambiguity over basic transition processes, lack of awareness about core political principles, and difficulty in constructively discussing polarizing topics. 

Intaj is a commercial production company established in 2012 by group of Libyan youth. Some of Intaj’s staff were members of the 212Group, which was founded during the revolution to support outreach on emerging issues during the revolution and shortly after the liberation. The group often does pro-bono or discounted work with civil society organizations on transition issues. For example, INTAJ worked with Lawyers for Justice in Libya on their recent “Destoori” campaign that conducted constitutional outreach across Libya. INTAJ has a nuanced understanding of the political processes in the country, a strong creative vision, a willingness to provoke discussion on contentious topics, and a very professional level of expertise in video production. 

This activity will create a rapid and responsive mechanism that enables INTAJ to develop five short videos united by a common theme in support of Libya’s political transition. The campaign will use quick, creative videos on timely topics that seek to inform the public and invigorate discussion. Specific subjects will be determined as the political context evolves and needs are identified, but potentially include the development of a new constitution, political exclusion, security, transparency and corruption, and local government. The grant will support field travel by the Tripoli-based production team to ensure that the videos reflect the voices and perspectives of Libya’s diverse communities. The grant will also invest in video production hardware that will ensure high-quality results, and will enable Intaj to increase its ability to contribute to awareness raisings campaigns by civil society organizations during the course of the transition. 

This activity assumes that raising awareness and stimulating discussion of key transition issues will contribute to constructive dialogue that promotes a peaceful political transition. It also assumes that the GNC will maintain the recent momentum and make progress in implementing transition milestones over the next three to six months.

",Strategic Planning for the Future: Training Support to LTI Information Centers,"
Since the liberation of the country in August 2011, severe tensions have occurred during the transition process. While the revolution opened Libya’s political space, after 42 years of repression, Libyans have little experience with political engagement and there is a lingering legacy of alienation. Many Libyans do not understand the basic vocabulary on the fundamentals of democracy, constitution making and elections. This lack of understanding inhibits effective and productive dialogue on transitional issues that are currently ongoing in the country. Also by not understanding these issues, the population and civil society, are constrained in their contributions and their ability to effectively participate in the process is weakened.
This activity is part of a cluster of information technology centers that the Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) is supporting in order to empower civil society to access information, engage in debate, and participate in the political transition process.  LTI is in the process of supporting the establishment of approximately ten information centers in Yefren, Murzuq, Kufra, Bayda with four other locations to be determined. These centers aim to empower both civil society organizations (CSOs) and the general public to acquire information and engage in peaceful and constructive dialogue about Libya's transition.  
This activity will support the provision of a consultant/consultancy firm for the training and strategic planning with the centers’ local partners in ensuring the sustainability of their respective centers. Each of the centers will be offered a three-day training that will assist the groups in establishing mechanisms for income generation such as a fee/center subscription structure for usage of the center; identify what resources are needed for the management and maintenance of the center; assist the center in facilitating a conversation with the users at the center on moving from the current model to an income generating model to obtain appropriate feedback from those that use the center; and develop guidelines for the management of any funds that the center will obtain and a general management plan of the center.
By providing such service to these centers, LTI will support the creation of a more viable space that will assist key local partners to develop skills and tools necessary to mobilize advocacy networks, meaningfully engage in political processes, and monitor the transition’s progress with a particular focus on traditionally marginalized constituencies (e.g. women, youth, minority groups, and southern regions). Additionally, LTI is looking at bringing in other STTAs to provide additional advocacy skills and online media training to help civil society more effectively use the computer center as an advocacy platform. 
The assumption behind this activity is that by supporting the viability of these centers, there will be increased access to information and skills and that these will contribute to Libyans playing a more active role in the transitional processes. By empowering people to learn about the constitution, women’s rights, reconciliation, transitional justice and other related transition issues through IT and the center, this will facilitate discussions and dialogue around the constitution drafting period. The centers will function as a medium for people to gather and learn about political issues.

This activity builds upon LTI’s support for establishment of IT centers throughout Libya in Yefren, Murzuq, Kufra, Rabyanah, Al Bayda, and other areas that have been viewed as traditionally marginalized constituencies (e.g. women, youth, minority groups, and the southern regions). This support is part of a holistic effort to create information points and space for meaning engagement and dialogue throughout the country focusing on marginalized areas.

",Transition Knowledge in a Box: Information Kits for Outreach and Engagement,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

One of the LTI’s main strategic objectives is to promote inclusive participation by an informed public in the transition’s main milestones, with a particular focus on traditionally marginalized constituencies (e.g. women, youth, minority groups, and the southern regions). LTI has supported numerous activities aimed at assisting key local partners to develop skills and tools necessary to mobilize advocacy networks, meaningfully engage in political processes, and monitor the transition’s progress. 

Currently the program is creating a network of internet centers across the country and has centers in Tripoli (at the Mafqood Center), Yefren, and Murzuq. Centers will be established in Kufra (both in the Zway and Tebu areas), Rabyanah and Al Bayda with possible centers in Dirj, Awbari, Ghat, and Tarzibu for an approximate total of twelve centers. These centers will be considered potential points of entry for this activity and/or CSO from these areas as many people living in these areas and surrounding towns, lack internet service and any electronic information or a place to meet and learn about constitutional processes, transitional justice and any other topic relates to the transitional period.  

The following are some of the illustrative activities that the centers and/or CSOs may engage in over the course of the next year.  

a)	Key Political Processes: encourage dialogue and development of a new national constitution and address other transition related processes transitional justice, conflict mitigation, etc. through education, outreach, and advocacy campaigns.  
b)	Social Media and Media: increase access to information and expand forums for public discourse by facilitating national and local media to provide improved coverage of the transition.  
c)	Civil society: assist key local partners to develop skills and tools necessary to mobilize advocacy networks, meaningfully engage in political processes, and monitor the transition’s progress.

This activity aims to support the provision of information kits for the centers. Support for these will build on LTI’s foundation of internet centers currently ongoing and past experience with local organizations and assist civil society to take the next step in participating in Libya’s political transition. This initiative seeks to empower civil society to be more effective partners for information dissemination campaigns and will foster the creation of platforms, through the centers and key partners, for public engagement in the political process, and activities that strengthen moderate voices in civil society to be catalysts for progressive change. 

These kits will contain printed materials, DVD film boxes, and a laptop computer and projector. The DVD film box sets will include a film kit including select films from TRIP038 - Looking at Human Rights from Different Perspectives-Tripoli Hosts Film Festival! And TRIP037 - Libya Elections Live! TV Shows in the Lead-Up to Election Day (which films will be dependent on obtaining the necessary permissions from the production companies).  The DVDs will also include the PSAs produced under previous grants, such as TRIP047 with 2.0v media and TRIP030 with Phoenix, among others.   These grants supported information outreach and engagement on transitional topics such as human rights, transitional justice, role of women and youth in transition, reconciliation, disarmament, and the constitution to name a few. The printed materials will contain information on the constitution and local government with flexibility for additional information through posters, booklets and bags promoting tolerance. 

This activity assumes that promoting engagement of the centers and civil society will support a credible and stable transition that reinforces national unity and results in representative, accountable institutions.

",Mapping Conflict Management Actors in Libya – Nationally and in Kufra,"
Kufra is a central hub in Libya’s strategic periphery. The main city in the Southeast’s vast deserts, Kufra is a corridor for regional smuggling, a flashpoint for inter-ethnic conflict, and a significant source of oil. The revolution produced a shift in local power politics and precipitated a scramble for control over lucrative smuggling routes. In 2012, over 200 people died in fighting, mainly between the Arab Zway tribe and the Tebu, a group spread throughout southern Libya, Chad, and Niger. There was a steady stream of small-scale fighting throughout the year, punctuated by two large bursts of violence in February and June of 2012 that were only paused by fragile ceasefires. This small-scale fighting and killings has continued into 2013 with recent clashes threatening to unhinge the precarious situation in Kufra and the surrounding areas. The area’s remoteness and poor infrastructure inhibit incident reporting and make it difficult to get a complete picture of past violence or accurate indicators for renewed instability. Declining security and growing signs of extremism in the surrounding areas increase both the supply and demand for destabilizing illicit goods that are channeled through southern border towns like Kufra. 

The lack of effective state authority is creating a vacuum in local governance that is being filled by ethnically-divided bodies.  The unelected Kufra Local Council is composed entirely of Zway. The Tebu have countered by creating their own groups, including the Ayyan Council. As a result, in Kufra the post-revolution transition is constricting the political space, hardening ethnic fault lines, and fueling conflict that is difficult to contain once ignited. 

Libyan society is undergoing a number of important changes as a result of the revolution / conflict in 2011, most evident in the development of new governance and political processes. At the same time, experiences of the revolution / conflict have also created a range of ‘peacebuilding’ challenges that need to be addressed jointly by state and not-state actors for these changes to be successful and peaceful. These challenges include grievances between communities, the desire for justice, and the need to transition from armed groups to trusted national security and justice institutions.

While consensus is growing around the challenges themselves, the initiatives to respond to them have been fragmented, with a range of actors often conducting parallel activities and with lack of clarity over who are the most effective and / or legitimate actors. This has inhibited the effectiveness of those working on conflict (mediators, peacebuilders and conflict prevention experts) as well as of those working in conflict (development actors working in more fragile communities). 

As such, this grant aims to map out – in as participatory a manner as possible – (a) nationally relevant actors for mediation,  peacebuilding and conflict prevention (collectively ‘conflict management’), and (b) those relevant for conducting conflict-sensitive development activities in Kufra. 

The assumption is that a better understanding of nationally relevant ‘conflict management’ actors – will help support and create a basis for more effective programming in this area. Additionally, a fundamental understanding of the linkages between local and national conflict management actors may provide possibly opportunities for programming and/or leveraging current actors work and influence in areas were LTI programming is operational.

The grant will replace essential equipment damaged during the revolution, provide a reliable and secure wireless connection between the station’s control room and transmitter, procure a new 5KW transmitter that will enable VFS to reach a wider audience with a clearer sound quality, and produce a series of new transition-related program segments that will air over the next three months. Sabha is the central city in the critical southwest region, where state presence is weak, political progress has faltered, and the area’s diverse communities remain divided and disconnected. One of the the major radio stations in southern Libya, VFS is the only station producing local content in Sabha, and it has become the primary radio forum for people in the area to gain information and engage in discussions on the transition.

",Expanding the Reach of the Radio in the South: The Voice of Free Sabha,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust towards government.  

Sabha is the central city in the southwest region, which is critical to the stability of Libya’s post-revolution transition. State presence is weak, political progress has faltered, and the area’s diverse communities remain divided and disconnected. Although the revolution shifted the balance of local power dynamics, the transition has not altered the deeply rooted legacy of patronage politics, tribal manipulations, and underdevelopment that characterized four decades of Qadhafi’s rule. As a result, old issues and new dynamics are fueling a pervasive sense of marginalization, funneling conflict along communal fault lines, and fanning fears that opportunistic extremists will fill the space in search of a safe haven and smuggling routes.

The Voice of Free Sabha (VFS) started in 1995 as a part of the state-run Aljamahiryia Broadcasting Agency. It was taken off the air during the revolution and taken over by revolutionaries around September 2011. In August 2011, authorities in Tripoli ordered the previous radio station leadership to sabotage and steal equipment so that it did not fall into the hands of thuwar. The station began rebroadcasting in September 2011. VFS is managed by Abubakr Abushrei’aa, and he has worked in media for 17 years, and is one of the few employees from the previous management who continued to work for the new station. Most of VFS’s staff are young volunteers from the area. VFS's competition in Sabha is Radio Wataniya, which rebroadcasts programming from Tripoli. 

VFS is the only station producing local content in Sabha, and it has become the primary radio forum for people in area to gain information and engage in discussions on transition-related issues. VFS produces a range of informative content, including a daily morning news show, call-in programs that connect community members with government officials, and thematic discussion shows on important transition issues like constitution development and reconciliation. 

This grant will provide essential hardware to address three key issues and give VFS more reliable and robust broadcasting capacity during the transition period:

1. Replace equipment damaged or stolen during the revolution: Studio equipment including a sound mixer, microphones, and desktop computer;

2. Fix the link between the control room and broadcast transmitter: The wireless link between the station in Sabha and the transmitter, which is located 10 km away from town, went down in November 2012 and took the station off of the air for 20 days. As a temporary stop gap, VFS has resorted to a direct wired connection between the control room and the broadcast station. This has several big drawbacks. First, it is less reliable because it is more vulnerable to environmental disruptions or sabotage. Second, it significantly reduces the quality of the broadcast (FM broadcasts normally have 2 channel stereo, and the wired link has 1 channel); 

3. Replace the broadcast transmitter: VFS currently has an old, partially damaged 1 kilowatt transmitter that reaches Sabah and the immediately surrounding cities. The range can extend as far as Birak, the closest significant population center to Sabah, but the quality of the signal is poor and unreliable. A 5 kilowatt transmitter would enable VFS to reach most towns in Birak with greater consistency. It is also possible that the improved transmitter will enable VFS to reach a number of towns in the Wadi al’ajal and Murzuq Areas.

VSF will also produce a new series of half-hour programs that will air twice a week for three months focusing on civil society activities, transition-related issues such as the constitution drafting process, political topics, and news in Sabha and the southwest. 

Wadi Al Shati district, North to north-west of Sabha, has a population of 85,000 that inhabit a number of towns spread on a 140 Km long strip, with Birak being the capital. Inhabitants of the district, as the neighboring southern district, are suffering from a lack of information portals that focus on their local issues. There was a radio station that existed in Wadi Al Shati, unfortunately it was shut down after the war broke, and was rendered inoperative as all equipment was moved out. The southern city of Murzuq is located on the northern edge of the Murzuq Great Dunes Desert, lying about 100 miles from Sabha.  It has an estimated population of 45,000 of mixed racial backgrounds (Tebu, Arab, Tuareg) and is considered one of the main cities of the Libyan south.

This grant assumes that improving access to information about the transition will promote a more inclusive process that yields more credible and stable institutions.

",Libya through the Lens of Unity,"
Two years into Libya's tenuous political transition, there is declining confidence in government institutions, severe strains on national unity, and a critical need for practical initiatives that promote reconciliation. A national dialogue to bring together Libyan political, social, and economic leaders to devise a political vision for the future of the country is critical at this time. While the government has been slow to take the lead, civil society can play a catalytic role, and creative arts produced by moderate voices are an excellent way to broach these highly sensitive topics of reconciliation and national unity.

Recently many Libyan NGOs and production companies striving for positive change are utilizing creative methods to promote national unity and reconciliation among frustrated, and at times resentful, citizens. Naziha Arebi and her colleagues in Huna Production Company believe that Libya’s broad and diverse history is something that should be celebrated as a rich national identity rather than diluted down, as was the practice under the previous regime. Libya has known many walks of life; it is evident in her geography and landscapes, from ancient rock paintings, to the architecture and legacies of the Greek, Roman, Ottoman, Jewish, Berber, Tebu, Twareg, and Arab peoples. During this post-conflict, transitional stage in Libya, it is very easy for Libyans to see differences as a mechanism for division, rather than focus on their history as a shared unifier. 

While the constitution has yet to be written, and countless pieces of legislation face delays, it does not mean the effort for a united Libya has to freeze until the right procedures are in place for accountability and justice. Themes of reconciliation can be promoted, albeit in a sensitive and indirect manner given the frustrations of Libyans by delays in the transitional justice process which many consider must take place before reconciliation is to be achieved. Therefore the issue and the word reconciliation will not even be mentioned within this activity; it will be more about challenging Libyans to consider their own diversity and inspiring a feeling of unity and identity through shared traditions.

In this aim, Huna Production will create three 60-90 second PSAs that encourage national unity, noting similarities in traditions across the different regions of Libya while also celebrating their differences. This will be done through tangible, common signifiers that all Libyans relate to such as food, tea ceremonies, weddings, and music, which can be used to address the idea of unity and reconciliation through a soft approach.  Each PSA will be shot in three locations for a total of nine different locations throughout Libya.  The initial cities proposed are Nalut, Khoms, Sirte, Murzuq, Ghadames, Derna, Awbari, Misratah, and Bani Walid, which are selected to represented a wide variety of peoples and landscapes as well as target some existing conflicts such as between Misratah and Bani Walid, or prejudice against minority groups like the Twareg and Tebu peoples.  Each PSA will take the same format with a similar pace of varied landscapes, interiors, close ups of activities and faces, and demonstrate the diversity, the joy and celebration of the scenario's taking place.

This activity will also provide professional camera and production for Huna production. Their overarching vision is to improve and develop Libyan cinema and to use creative content as a tool for stimulating dialogue and advocating change. In Libya there are many aspiring film makers, but to produce work at an international professional level you need not only talent and vision, but also professional equipment. At a time when people have had enough of being talked at the impact of visual mediums is heightened.  Libya has gone from a 42 year absence of choice to having over 13 channels. Libyans watch a lot of TV and although there is a lot of Libyan news content, there is a gap in the viewing content with regards to depicting local issues and stories through documentary, drama and cinema. The media has a large role to play in the Libyan transition by not only providing news, but creating understanding and inspiring dialogue. More so than news, creative documentaries and films can address these issues in a more accessible manner. Central to creative documentary, the field in which Huna Productions works is the notion of human, character driven stories with universal subjects that an audience can relate to; this is an element they will also bring to the PSA's. The aim of Huna Production’s current feature length film project, “Freedom Fields,” putting football aside, is to inspire Libyans to have hopes and dreams, against all odds, and utilize their new freedom and power to shape their own destinies. For a nation traumatized by conflict, these simple ideals, along with a feeling of national identity and unity are not only cathartic but necessary in providing hope during these difficult months of transition. 

Huna Productions is a new organization established in February 2013, after Director and Producer Huda Abuzeid and Creative Director Naziha Arebi had worked together on a number of projects for other organizations and production companies.   Huna Productions was born out of the realization that theirs was a very special collaboration and that their partnership would have greater longevity if they set up a company together to commission their own work rather than just working for others. They intend to continue working on projects that aim to advocate change during Libya's transitional period.  As a production team, they have already designed several campaigns, made short films and conducted trainings for Libyans new in the film industry. Their anti-sexual harassment campaign received wide praise on social media and they are in late development stages of their first feature documentary “Freedom Fields.”  Huna Productions also provided training for the Libyan NGO 'Together We Build' for their Leaders of Innovation workshops and are currently assisting the 1Libya NGO with its women’s rights campaign. While they are working with a long term strategy to combine profitable and meaningful work, they are funded on a project by project basis. Huna Productions have young volunteers who work with them in exchange for basic training in Final Cut and camera skills.

The equipment procured under this activity will not only support the three national unity PSAs, but will further contribute to Huna Production’s future work raising awareness of important issues in Libya.  One such project will be their documentary film ‘’Freedom Fields’’ which tells the story of passionate female footballers in their journey to discover and empower the women of Libya through sport. Their dream is to form the first national Libyan Women's football team, but first they must fight not only the objections of their families, the football federation and the cultures mentality; they must also find reconciliation within the team, split by their alliances during the revolution. 

The campaign will use quick, creative videos on cultural topics to encourage unity and national reconciliation that will promote peace in Libya.  The director has selected topics such as rituals and music to be used instead of formal political language to reach average Libyans.  The grant will support field travel by the Tripoli-based production team to ensure that the videos reflect the traditions and perspectives of Libya’s diverse communities. The grant will also invest in video production equipment that will ensure high-quality results, and will enable Huna to increase its ability to contribute more in creative ways during the course of the transition. 

This activity assumes that raising awareness and stimulating discussion of key transition issues will contribute to constructive dialogue that promotes a peaceful political transition. By encouraging a sense of national pride and identity, celebrating the similarities and embracing the differences in society and seeing Libyan diversity as an asset rather than a problem, these PSAs will contribute to constructive dialogue that promotes a peaceful political transition.

This grant aims to increase transparency and raise understanding about political processes by enhancing the ability of civil society to monitor the activities of the General National Congress (GNC). The 'Eye on GNC' is a bi-monthly report produced by two prominent youth-led organizations, H20 in Tripoli and Bokra in Benghazi, and companion grant will provide similar support to Bokra. Specifically, this activity will improve monitoring of legislative activities during a critical phase in the transition by providing internet access and video recording equipment to H20, as well as promote better visibility of the 'Eye on GNC' by printing the report as a supplement in two popular Tripoli-based newspapers and printing 3,000 booklets (2,000 in Arabic and 1,000 in English) that will be distributed through civil society organizations and key stakeholders. Combined with the grant to Bokra, this activity plans to have a nation-wide reach, focusing on youth and those interested in the political and legislative process in an effort to close the existing gap between the public and the elected legislative body.

","Left Eye: Supporting ""Eye on the GNC"" from Tripoli","
In July 2012, Libyan voters flooded the polling stations all around the country, to participate in the first election to be held in over 40 years in Libya. The successful election resulted the formation of the 200 members General National Conference (GNC), the country’s legislative body that is tasked with the mission of steering Libya’s transition towards a constitutional democracy. The GNC was consequently responsible for forming a government and guiding the constitutional drafting process among other responsibilities.

Given the country’s recent history of dictatorship and authoritarian rule, there is a general lack of participation by citizens in the political process. There is also the absence of unbiased non-partisan source of information on the legislative activities and the transition process, which have resulted in widening the gap between the voters and the elected GNC and lowering the public’s confidence in the implementation of the transitional road map.

“Eye on the GNC” is a joint project where both organizations Bokra and H20 work on observing and monitoring the national congress through reports which are released every 15 days for a period of one year, these reports and analysis included, though not always in each report, monitoring of the national congress, political parties and their reaction towards the progress of the national congress, the media and how it handles the ideas and points of view of the national congress and the political parties, the non-governmental organizations and their reaction towards the performance of the national conference and the political parties and how the Libyan street and the public reacts while signaling some events related to the subject. The team monitors forms of media including television and radio with these categories in mind. These reports include all laws, regulations, decisions and the data issued by the national congress including the views and visions of the political parties and the members of the national congress regarding these decisions and what comes along from debates.

This activity aims at closing the gap of information that exists around and about the GNC by providing news and information on the legislative and parliamentary activities in a simplified and digestible manner, in the form of bi-weekly reports and is produced by H2O in partnership with BOKRA –a local NGO from Benghazi. These reports include Laws, Decisions, and data issued by the GNC, it also includes the views and reactions of political parties and members of the GNC. 

The proposed grantee, the H2O Team, has implemented many related activities funded by USAID/OTI and other donors, such as an outreach awareness raising project on the transitional “road map,” a voter education campaign, and trainings for civil society NGOs in Tripoli and Benghazi on successful outreach strategies. To date, H20, and Bokra – its counterpart and partner in Benghazi, have completed nine reports and all of them are published on the H20 Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/H2OLY (currently with approximately 25,500 likes) and on the official web on the official site http://www.ignc.net.ly/. 

This activity will support H2O with equipment for monitoring and reporting of the GNC through the provisions of digital video recording equipment, V-Sat internet broadband with subscription, and will increase the report’s accessibility by publishing of the bi-weekly report in Febra’yer [in Arabic] and Tripoli Post [in English] newspapers, sponsoring the online version on Facebook and the printing of 3,000 copies [2,000 Arabic, 1,000 English] of reports published until end of grant period. Febray'yer's circulation is 7,000 copies per day with 5,000 copies in Tripoli itself and the remaining 2,000 copies for the western region. The Tripoli Post circulation is 850 copies in Tripoli, 400 in Benghazi and 300 in Sabha. Additionally, stipends will be provided to a project coordinator and two monitor over a six month time period. 

The activity assumes that by providing such information, and by positively engaging in the political process as observers, it will help the general public gain valuable insight on the legislative process, and promote public participation in the transition.

",Bringing the Constitution to Civil Society in Awbari,"
In September 2011, Libya’s Transitional National Council released a Constitutional Charter for the Transitional Stage of the country’s democratic development and in July 2012 Libya successfully held its first democratic elections in more than four decades. The 200 members of the General National Congress that was consequently appointed were charged with appointing the Constitution-Drafting Committee to guide Libya through the constitutional-development process.

Libya is faced with many uncertainties regarding the constitution drafting process. Decisions are yet to be made regarding the role the public will play in this crucial process prior to the planned national referendum that will see a draft constitution adopted or rejected. The timeline for the constitution’s development is also uncertain, as is the extent to which the new constitution will incorporate elements of its pre-Qadhafi 1951 predecessor.

With so much uncertainty regarding the process by which the constitution will be developed, let alone its content, there is a need for factual, unbiased information presented in a readily accessible manner. This need is particularly great in southern Libya, where tensions are already rising over key constitutional issues, such as federalism and control of state natural resources. Providing information about the constitution-drafting process and various mechanisms for engagement will both promote stability during this crucial period in Libya’s political transition and provide communities with information needed to avail themselves of engagement mechanisms when these are presented as the constitution-drafting process develops.

In December 2012, the Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) supported the training of 50 civil society members and former revolutionary fighters from three key districts in the South on the substance of the constitution and subsequent processes in the lead-up to the referendum. The participants were able to obtain information on the constitution and develop a basic skills set in which they can train and/or conduct outreach campaigns in their communities while providing unique opportunity for Libyans to own these skills and promote this key transitional process and contribute to the sustainability of democratic education process.  

Now, LTI looks to take the knowledge and skills learned from this training one step further. There is a gap in providing simple and basic information on constitutional concepts and process, and making such information accessible to Awbari, a key district in the southwestern part of the country between Sabha and Ghat. 

The Toumast Youth Coalition is well placed to engage in civic education and awareness campaigns in Awbari, given their resources and networking within the city of Awbari and beyond, especially with the Twareg community which make for a significant portion of the population in the southwest region.  Awbari is an important hub for the Twareg people of Libya, a minority group who like the Amazigh and Tebu peoples have a special interest in learning about the constitution so to inform future advocacy campaigns to protect their rights, particularly around sensitive issues of language and citizenship.

Through this activity, the coalition is planning an intensive 2-day workshop on the constitution for about 20-25 members of civil society and activists in Awbari.  After this workshop, participants will be divided into small groups that will lead outreach campaigns in which they prepare and disseminate information targeted at youth and civil society.

This activity assumes that by engaging with youth and civil society, increasing their awareness of the constitution-drafting process and providing them with opportunities to engage with communities, they will be able to advance public understanding of constitutional development processes and engagement opportunities, transfer knowledge to the otherwise neglected or marginalized sectors of the community, and thereby promote public participation in Libya’s transition to democracy.

",Team Ushahidi! Mapping the Transition in Libya,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Gaddafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

In many Tripoli neighborhoods people complain about being marginalized by the government, and there is a serious lack of basic service delivery. These repeated scenarios have led to a general sense of frustration and disengagement among the Libyan public. As a result, Libya has witnessed a large number of political protests around the country, and more recently, there has been an upsurge in political violence and more prominent voicing of extremist ideology. 

Libyan citizens feel constrained in their contributions and their ability to effectively participate in the transition process. A key part of this problem is the weak relationship between the state and citizens, and the lack of channels and tools for constructive political engagement, especially among the youth population. This is what led youth led organizations such as Momken to search for new creative ways to encourage people to stay engaged in the political processes. 

Momken is a youth led organization that is an offshoot from Alleqa, which previously implemented TRIP015, an election awareness campaign. As their activities have grown more broad in scope, they have established a new organization named Momken to be focused more on political awareness through technology, and media related programs to engage Libyan public - and particularly the youth - in the transition.

Ushahidi was created in 2008 to build tools for democratizing information, increasing transparency and lowering the barriers for individuals to share their stories. The Momken team has some experience using Ushahidi, as they had a project monitoring the GNC elections. The project generated a total of 80 reports in one day, something they considered successful taking into account the Libyan transitions circumstances, infrastructure, communication problems, and limited use of new technologies among citizens. 

With that experience the team stayed in contact with their Egyptian trainer “Kamal Sedra” an International Geo-Mapping consultant, Cyber-Activist, Digital Security and digital media expert. Kamal is the founder and Managing Director of Development and Institutionalization Support Center “DISC” (www.DISCntr.org) in Egypt. The company goals are promoting democracy, human rights and freedom of expression values worldwide, with a focus Egypt and the Middle East, by strengthening youth and civil society through the use of new media.

The trainer and his team have implemented around fifty projects for international partners including USAID, Foundation for the Future, MEPI, ICT4Peace Foundation and Freedom House. Some of their big projects were elections monitoring (in 2011 in Tunisia, and in 2010 & 2011 in Egypt), all using Ushahidi technology. One of their projects called Nazaha, a government transparency initiative was honored as one of the “Top Ten Websites Who Change the World” in 2009 by the E-Democracy Forum. 

Kamal’s past experience in the Arab World helped him to formulate and develop capacity building training programs specialized for NGOs and civil society organizations (CSOs). In addition to training on Ushahidi, Kamal includes aspects of project management and marketing principles into the program, and has conducted this training in many Arabic countries. 

The training under this activity consists of four basic sessions, the first part of the program teaches how to set up and develop Ushahidi platforms. The second part helps understand how to manage the mapping aspects of the platform and handle the received reports through SMS and emails citizens. The third part teaches marketing skills to help reach and inform citizens around the country. The fourth and last part devoted for how to handle and manage campaigns and projects related to media and IT.

This activity will offer Momken team of 25 participant’s important skills and equipment that will contribute to their capacity and help them achieve their goals, to lower the barriers for individuals to share their stories to encourage their political engagement. School violence against youth, potholes in streets, random building of shops everywhere, all issues Momken wish to map using Ushahidi platform after they gain the main skills. As part of the training program, the team will also present a pilot project which will build on the skills they have gained and demonstrate their capacity to implement further, more ambitious, activities.

This activity assumes that by strengthening youth engagement in the transition process and help build their capacity; they will be able to advance public expression and advocate for change in attitudes that could help mitigate conflicts that destabilize the transition.

",Art Activism: Supporting Theater and the Arts in Libya,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

While the government has been slow to take the lead, civil society can play a catalytic role, and creative arts produced by moderate voices are an excellent way to broach timely topics like the importance of the rule of law and non-violent participation in the political process. Despite the political and social gains made by Libyans since the February 17th revolution, the cultural and arts scenes in the country still suffer from the weakness of the country’s political, legal, and cultural infrastructures along with a shortage of coherent and transparent support mechanisms. These deficiencies are compounded by a lack of strategic vision, training opportunities, and managerial expertise in the arts.

Arete Foundation for Arts and Culture is a Libyan national, non-profit organization that seeks to support, guide, and facilitate artistic creativity and cultural exchanges within Libya. Arete believes that the arts create a realm where language, ideas, and conventions are examined, reshaped, and refined. Using various styles, approaches, and representational techniques artists can reach to the depths of political, social, cultural, and philosophical questions and in so doing create and promote solidarity with others. Establishing their organization after the success of the February 17th revolution that brought four decades of dictatorship to an end, they view the arts, at this juncture in Libya’s history and beyond, as a necessary means to affirm, promote, and seek variety, depth, and exuberance in life. These contributions that the arts and artists make are indispensable for the development of Libya as a democratic, tolerant, and dynamic society. Their main approach has focused on exposing the Libyan arts community to new ideas and varied forms of expression in literature, music, and the visual arts. Since our inception in April 2012 their projects have included:

•	 Co-organizing Tripoli’s International Poetry Festival, April 2012.
•	 Running a series of lectures titled Arete Talks (since February 2012).
•	 School of Rock (rock music workshop), July 2013.
•	 FIRST GLANCE: a video Art Exhibit in Tripoli’s Old City, November 2012.
•	 The Arete Cinema Club: screened 50 films in Tripoli since Oct. 2012, and has just expanded to 3 new locations.

This activity is will stage a four-day performance of Henrik Ibsen’s Enemy of the People by the 15-member Egyptian La Musica Dramatic Troup at the Kashaf Theater in Tripoli. Each performance will be followed by a discussion session with audience members on the play’s key themes. In early 2013, the play was adapted and performed by Egyptian artist Nora Amin (Lamusica Independent Theater Group. The theater production was organized and directed by Nora Amin (who herself plays the role of Doctor Stockman's wife) and starred Tarek El-Dewiri as Doctor Thomas Stockman. The play was translated into colloquial Arabic and featured a rock-themed soundtrack played live on-set. It received many positive reviews and was jointly sponsored by the Norwegian Embassy in Cairo and the Ibsen Studies Center in Norway. The show came at a time when Egypt and the capital, Cairo were plunged into deep turmoil, and the play became popular for discussing issues of serious political relevance in post-revolutionary Egypt through the creative arts. 

This play is an excellent example of engaged art that can hit at the heart of similar issues and themes raised in Libya. It is a play essentially about mob rule and how mob mentality can lead a whole community to lose its moral compass. Arete believes that Ibsen’s play can engage Libyan audiences in discussions on relevant but sensitive political issues, help empower the intellectual community, and rejuvenate public discourse in the midst of the extremist conversations dominating the airwaves in Libya.

This activity assumes that by presenting a play about the danger of mob rule, the importance of the rule of law, and the necessity to respect individual liberty during this pivotal and unstable time in Libya’s transition, Libyan voices that support non-violence and a peaceful political process will be strengthened.

The Qaddafi regime, following the inconsistencies outlined in the green book, which acted as a guiding framework and through the big-man politics and erratic nature of Qaddafi and his close supporters effectively kept institutional structure and administrative processes weak to non-existent. Two years after the fall of this regime, Libyans have progressed in their understanding of needs and solutions. However, the limited institutional development continues to stall progress in implementing these plans. Across the spectrum of sectors, competing and overlapping authorities among institutions, combined with an inability of any of these institutions to practically implement decisions and plans make follow-through on plans impossible and increase unproductive competition and conflict within the government. The government continues to request international support to build their capacity in these areas. 
The Prime Minister’s office has created a Decision Support Unit to advise one higher-level government decisions. Currently, the unit has limited staff and capacity. In a meeting with the U.S. Charge D’Affairs, the Prime Minister requested support, directed through the UN to provide an advisor that could assist in improving inter-ministerial coordination. Yet, the UN is currently unable to house such a position and has no mechanism to hire for the position. Therefore an agreement was made by which OTI will hire, deploy and support this advisor, who will be embedded in the Decision Support Unit and coordinate with relevant UN bodies for a period of 6 months until an alternative mechanism is set up. 
An interagency evaluation committee identified a number of higher-level advisors experienced in inter-ministerial coordination in the region, held interviews and presented the top candidates to the Prime Minister and the head of the Decision Support Unit for final selection. The advisor is expected to arrive in Libya the end of July.

","Strengthening Moderate Voices: Understanding Attitudes, Islam & the Constitution","
Libya’s new constitution represents a great opportunity to lay the foundations for a peaceful and tolerant Libyan society. However, of all the issues that the constitution will have to deal with, the interaction between Islam and the state are arguably the most fundamental, the most poorly comprehended, the most divisive, but the least debated. This combination of factors means that this issue has the potential to disrupt the whole political process. Egypt and Tunisia are stark examples of where post Arab-spring constitution-building processes have stalled, in part due to popular distrust in the Islamic nature of the proposed constitutions.

The role of shari’a (Islamic law) in the new constitution and future legislation will likely be a particularly divisive area. There are a multitude of interpretations of how broadly and rigorously shari’a could be implemented. This is a concern for Libya: firstly, public opinions may be being unduly shaped by the opinions of a vocal and visible minority, and secondly, lessons from pre-and post-revolutionary Egypt and Tunisia have shown that a plurality of views means that a national agreement on one definition of shari’a that has popular legitimacy continues to be elusive.

With the passage of the law to elect the constitution drafting committee, there is window of opportunity to stimulate informed and balanced national debate in advance of the constitution-writing process. This activity will support a national phone survey and key informant interviews to shed light on popular opinions and shape future outreach activities. The objective is to support inclusive dialogue that reflects diverse views and incorporates reliable data by:

a.	  Determining the general Islamic orientations of the Libyan population towards certain Islamic denominations and Islamic figureheads, and understanding Libyans’ perceptions of changes in society and Islam over recent months;
b.	  Understanding specific attitudes to the interaction of Islam and the state, including national models, governance systems, legal systems, education, shari’a in the constitution, shari’a in legislation, and responsibilities for interpreting shari’a;
c.	  Using the findings of the research to develop concepts for an information, education and communication (IEC) campaign promoting relevant and moderate messages about Islam and the constitution, leveraging Altai’s understanding of Libyan media to maximize the impact of the messages within different demographic profiles;
d.	  Developing these IEC campaign concepts in a manner that they could be easily actualized by USAID/OTI’s partners in Libya, such as NGOs, media outlets, etc.

Altai Consulting is a research and consulting firm operating in fragile and conflict-affected states in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. In Libya, Altai has partnered with a local partner, Istishari Research and Consulting, to develop a national network of field researchers, managed by a team of national and international consultants based in Tripoli. Altai will conduct around 30 key informant interviews (KIIs) in eight cities with a number of figures of influence, including prominent sheikhs, muftis, qadis, judges, tribal leaders, law professors, officials from the Ministry of Awqaf, Justice, Education, GNC members, potential Constitutional Assembly members, and NGO leaders. The planned cities are: Tripoli, Benghazi, Misrata, Zuwara, Bayda, Sirte, Sabha and Awbari. Additionally, Altai will also use its Tripoli-based call center to conduct a statistically representative national survey in all 22 districts of Libya, with oversampling in a number of key cities (Tripoli, Benghazi, Sabha, Misrata, and Zuwara) to garner more in-depth insights and allow direct comparison between these key cities. In three other locations of interest -- Awbari, Kufra and Derna -- large oversampling is not possible with a call-center approach, but Altai will complete 50 interviews in each location to allow a degree of comparison for these locations.

This activity assumes that robust data on local attitudes will stimulate informed debate on a sensitive topic and strengthen moderate voices to advocate against a vocal minority promoting extremist positions.

This constellation of centers will focus on peripheral areas so that marginalized groups – particularly women, youth, minority groups, and southern regions – can have platforms to access information, amplify their voices, and advocate for their interests. 

The initial round of information center grants has led to some valuable lessons learned. Marginalized communities in peripheral areas are extremely eager to receive resources that enable them to feed into transition processes by connecting with other civil society groups and government bodies. The centers provide a much needed avenue for information to reach and be received from isolated communities. However, setting up and maintaining a stable and sustainable internet connection and computer facility in remote areas is a challenging task that requires knowledgeable and vigilant oversight. It is important to proactively diagnose problems, troubleshoot solutions, and extract lessons learned that can be used to adapt the activity model for maximum effectiveness. 

Furthermore, the centers provide a platform of hardware that requires follow-on programming and coordination to have a signficant impact on the transition. Since this is a national effort that spans offices, integrated programmatic support is necessary in order to ensure that the centers are strategically leveraging LTI activities, linking into initiatives offered by the US embassy and other stakeholders, and utilizing the internet resources to communicate with each other. 

This activity responds to these lessons by providing a dedicated Information Center Coordinator (ICC) to offer concentrated programmatic and technical support to this critical and challenging cluster. The ICC will work with LTI staff and local partners to systematically and strategically seek synergies between the centers and activities that are in development by LTI or offered by other donors and stakeholders. The ICC will take the lead in technically assessing the centers and advising on ways to improve performance. The ICC will contribute to monitoring implementation, evaluating impact, and reporting on success stories and significant issues. The ICC will make frequent visits to the project sites, but will also be expected to develop innovative approaches for remotely engaging with the centers. 

This activity assumes that creating information centers in peripheral communities will promote inclusive participation in political and stabilization processes.

This grant aims to empower the Toumast Youth Coalition in Awbari to acquire information and engage in dialogue about Libya's transition by creating an information center with Internet access.  This activity will establish a computer room with sixteen computers, a VSAT, and a year’s Internet subscription at Toumast’s headquarters.  The center is located in Awbari, a large population hub in an isolated area of southern Libya that is home to the traditionally marginalized Twareg community. The Toumast Youth Coalition will manage the center and provide computer skills training to ensure that local civil society organizations have a safe, culturally-acceptable space to connect with people, communicate about issues, and participate in the political process.

",Supporting Civil Society’s Access to Information in Awbari,"
Since the liberation of the country in August 2011, severe tensions have occurred during the transition process. While the revolution opened Libya’s political space, after 42 years of repression, Libyans have little experience with political engagement and there is a lingering legacy of alienation. Many Libyans do not understand the basic vocabulary on the fundamentals of democracy, constitution making and elections. This lack of understanding inhibits effective and productive dialogue on transitional issues that are currently ongoing in the country. Also by not understanding these issues, the population, especially in areas outside of the major cities, and civil society, are constrained in their contributions and their ability to effectively participate in the process is weakened.

While the internet is very popular in Libya as a means for obtaining information, it is mostly limited to the coastal areas in addition to areas that were popular with tourists pre-revolution (e.g. Ghadames). As one travels into Nafusa Mountains or further south, access to the internet becomes very limited (e.g. Sabha and Awbari) to non-existent.

The Toumast Youth Coalition is well placed to host an information center at their headquarters.  They are a respected civil society organization that has engaged in civic education and awareness campaigns in Awbari, including a recent constitution awareness campaign supported by LTI (TRIP072).  They have an extensive network within the city of Awbari and beyond, especially with the Twareg community which make for a significant portion of the population in the southwest region.  Awbari is a key district in the southwestern part of the country between Sabha and Ghat. It is an important hub for the Twareg people of Libya, a minority group who like the Amazigh and Tebu peoples have a special interest in learning about the constitution and other legislation so to inform future advocacy campaigns to protect their rights, particularly around sensitive issues of language and citizenship.

This activity is aimed at the implementation of a computer center of sixteen computers, with VSAT broadband. It aims to create a suitable space where CSOs and the general population of Awbari will be able to access and share information about the issues related to the political transition and general news about Libya and the world.  It is anticipated that members of the Awbari Local Council will be able to use the center to publicize their frequent activities as well as important political developments on the Internet to reach a broader audience.  The IT trainings to be conducted at the center will also enable CSOs to become more proficient in the utilization of technology to advance their organizational goals, including promoting their activities through social media. In addition, two copies of Rosetta Stone software will be purchased for the center, to promote broader access to language learning and English language media resources.

People who live in Awbari and surrounding towns lack sufficient Internet service and a place to meet and learn about constitutional processes, transitional justice and other topics related to the transitional period.  Providing such a resource to the Toumast Youth Coalition will create a space that will assist key local partners, including the Awbari Local Council, to develop skills, networks, and tools necessary to mobilize advocacy networks, meaningfully engage in political processes, and monitor the transition’s progress with a particular focus on traditionally marginalized constituencies (e.g. women, youth, minority groups, and southern regions).

LTI plans to promote sustainability of the center by hiring an STTA who will work with the grantee to develop a business model to maintain Internet connection costs. Since LTI has implemented this type of civil society-internet center arrangement in multiple areas, this technical expertise is planned to be hired through a separate STTA rather than as a budget line for this individual grant. 

The assumption behind this activity is that increased access to information and skills will contribute to Libyans playing a more active role in the transitional processes. By empowering the public to learn about the constitution, human rights, reconciliation, transitional justice and other related transition issues through IT and the center, this will facilitate discussions and dialogue around key political processes such as the constitutional drafting process and elections. The center will function as a medium for people to gather and learn about political topics and it will be accessible to the general population of Awbari.

This grant aims to empower women in a remote area to acquire information and engage in dialogue about Libya's transition by creating an information center with internet access.  LTI will support the establishment of an information center with seventeen desktop computers, a VSAT Internet connection, and a year's Internet subscription. The center will be located in Ghadames, a significant population hub in an isolated area in western Libya on the border with Algeria and Tunisia.

Also by not understanding these issues, the population, especially in areas outside of the major cities, and civil society, are constrained in their contributions and their ability to effectively participate in the process is weakened.

While the Internet is very popular in Libya as a means for obtaining information, not all families have Internet access in their homes and women in Ghadames are restricted by societal norms from accessing public Internet cafes.  This center will allow women to connect with others locally and nationally to learn more about the activities and developments taking place in the political and cultural spheres.  

The Baraka Organization for Charitable Work is well placed to manage an information center.  They are a respected civil society organization that has engaged in civic education and awareness campaigns in Ghadames. Ghadames is a key district in western Libya, as it lies at the intersection of the Libyan, Algerian, and Tunisian borders, and has witnessed tensions due to its proximity to the borders as well as internal conflict between the Twareg and Arab Ghadamsian peoples. 

This activity is aimed at the implementation of a computer center of seventeen computers, with VSAT broadband. It aims to create a suitable space where women and CSOs will be able to access and share information about the issues related to the political transition and general news about Libya and the world.  The IT trainings to be conducted at the center will also enable women to become more proficient in the utilization of technology and learn more about how to participate in political processes such as the upcoming elections of the constitutional drafting committee.

Providing such a resource to the Baraka Organization for Charitable Work will create a space that will assist women and civil society organizations to develop skills, networks, and tools necessary to mobilize advocacy networks, meaningfully engage in political processes, and monitor the transition's progress. The center will be based in a school outbuilding, for which the grantee has secured permission to use for five years, and which provides a neutral space for women and CSO members to access information and IT resources in an informal location which is considered culturally appropriate.

LTI plans to promote sustainability of the center by hiring an STTA (TRIP066) who will work with the grantee to develop a business model to maintain Internet connection costs.

A technical consultant will be hired to design, develop, and support the website. A group of prominent civil society organizations plans to compile the data on candidate’s positions in order to create a voter’s guide prior to planned elections for the 60-member committee that will draft Libya’s new constitution and, depending on how the election process unfolds, this activity may be used to promote and publish the subsequent guide or related outreach material. The initiative seeks to ensure that voters are able to make an informed decision to elect candidates that reflect their views, and to enable civil society to monitor whether the performance of elected individuals is consistent with their campaign platforms.

",Voter's Guide & Outreach on the Constitutional Drafting Committee Elections,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

After long delays and much uncertainty, the GNC decided on February 06, 2013 to hold popular elections for the committee that will draft Libya’s post-revolution constitution. The law to elect the committee was approved by the GNC on July 16. Under the election law, the 60-member committee will be composed of 20 members from each of the nation’s three regions – East, West, and South. Six seats will be allocated for women, and three minority groups – Taureg, Tebu, and Amazigh -- will each receive two seats. The High Election Committee will be responsible for preparing the election, including voter registration, candidate registration, and developing the mechanisms to implement the election law. A timetable has not yet been established, but officials hope that an election can happened by the end of the 2013.

The election will enable voters to choose candidates that reflect their interests and ensure that their voices are represented in the drafting process. But to make an informed decision, voters must know the candidate’s positions on key issues such as decentralization, women’s rights, and shari’a. A clear statement of where candidates stand on issues will also enable the public to hold elected individuals accountable during the drafting process. As a result, a group of civil society organizations have decided to create a voter’s guide that documents candidate’s views. The groups are currently developing a questionnaire that each candidate will have an opportunity to answer. A website will be created where the candidates can answer the questions online or their answers can be entered in after being interviewed. Voters will then be able to view candidate’s responses on the website, and the data will eventually be published in a booklet that is widely promoted and distributed prior to elections. 

This activity will support the first phase of this process – the creation of website to collect and display candidate’s views. A web designer will be hired in order to design, develop, and test a site that candidates will login to in order to enter answers to the survey questions. The web designer will train members of the civil society groups to manage site content, and will provide continued technical support. While the timetable for elections is uncertain, it is important to get the site operational so that it is reliable and ready when candidate registration begins. LTI will also likely look to support the promotion and publication of the voter's guide at the appropriate time. 

This activity assumes that increasing access to information about the views of candidates for the constitution drafting committee will lead to more informed and inclusive public participation as well as a more transparent and accountable process.

This activity will promote reconciliation, open dialogue and national unity through a photo competition and exhibition while increasing the professional capacity of Libyan photojournalists. The activity will include a photojournalism competition, training for up to 15 photojournalists, and exhibitions in two cities; these will build the capacity of Libyan photojournalists, and focus on a theme related to ‘strengthening and uniting our own identity’.  After a nationwide competition, photojournalists will be trained in Tripoli, before having their work exhibited in both Benghazi and Tripoli. The activity will build upon LTI’s nationwide reach to engage a broad audience in the competition and theme, increasing the capacity of photojournalists, while also reaching out to the public at large to strengthen Libyan identity and unity.

",An Image of Libya: Building National Identity through Photojournalism,"
Media and photography in particular played an instrumental role in Libya’s revolution and fight for freedom. In Libya, photography and photojournalism captured moments in the nation’s history and moved people to take action. A fledging press requires skilled journalists, including those responsible for imagery.

Last year, 1Libya, in collaboration with USAID and IMS, implemented a photojournalism program which had a number of successes and impacted directly impacted members of the community. The winning photographer, Aymen Ashour, has established himself in the industry and building his career as a photographer working as a freelancer and in a marketing agency, and the second prize winner, female photographer Naziha Arebi, has further flourished with a number of successful projects and documentaries over the past year, including TRIP070.

The project’s Facebook page quickly garnered more than 3,000 fans (for comparison, the Italian Cultural Institute in Tripoli has, over several years, accrued less than 2,000) with lively discussion and comments on the pictures. The award ceremony and launch of the exhibition also received positive feedback from all the guests that attended, both in terms of the quality of the pictures as well as in the story that they told. 

The workshop for the top 15 photographers also received very positive feedback from all the participants. The week-long training allowed them to have both the theoretical understanding and a practical application of photojournalism. Through the training organically a network was established where participants are sharing industry know-how, collaborating on projects, and  learning from each other using the technical skills they developed in the training. 

We would like to support this nascent profession in Libya. The new project will serve as a platform for photographers to assess their interest, gain skills and potentially develop their career in this area. The exhibit will also expose a wider Libyan and international audience to new narratives of Libyan transition and unity. 

The theme for last year’s program, Libya: A Nation Reborn, was in line with the stage of development the country was in at the time. Themes proposed for this year include: ‘Democracy: A road less travelled’, ‘Growth through change’, ‘United We Stand’, ‘Values of a New Generation’, or ‘Many Faces of a Nation’.  This project is about inspiring photographers and the public about their collective future. By supporting media and pluralistic democracy through the lens of a camera, we are able to visually capture where we stand today as a nation in transition. In a period of frustrations and tension, this project allows space for reflection, and builds the capacity of the Libyan “fourth estate”. 

The overall theme of the activity is “uniting and strengthening our own identity”, and this will be emphasized throughout the different stages of the activity. The competition and book themes will be related to this, but will be more specific and decided through consultation within 1Libya on a theme which best represents the time and target audience, and which can be well expressed in Arabic.

This activity will promote photojournalism and Libyan unity through the following means: 1) organizing a nationwide photojournalism competition in Libya which will involve aspiring photojournalists from across the country, and provide cameras and other related equipment to up to four winning photographers. 2) Providing a 5 day training on photographic techniques to 15 winners from around the country, enabling them to continue to use their skills for journalism and artistic purposes in Libya. 3) Exhibiting the winning photographers’ work in two or more locations across the country (including Tripoli and Benghazi), and 4) creating printed books and other media in support of the event which will publicize the photographers’ work, and promote the theme of “uniting and strengthening our own identity” among the Libyan population across the country.

The assumptions behind this activity are twofold. First, this activity assumes that by engaging Libyan photojournalists, and improving their capacity to independently capture events and scenes, they will contribute to an increasingly professionalized media environment which encourages debate and freedom of expression. Second, this activity assumes that by promoting the overall theme of “uniting and strengthening our own identity”, Libyans will be encouraged to use their voice in a responsible manner which encourages national unity during the transition period.

The grant is designed to increase the capacity of both public bodies and community groups to understand and manage tensions and conflict over the long-term through the establishment of a conflict early warning and action system in the south, border areas and key conflict areas in Libya. It will look to provide the basis for more effective partnership / collaboration between public bodies and community groups, so as to create joint responsibility and ownership of conflict management. However, given the fluid nature of the political landscape in Libya, and the limited reach of national authorities in some communities, the initial focus in this project will be on building the capacity of communities and local civil society. The grant will also provide an entry point to potential further work on public capacity in this area, through consultation with the national authorities during project design and feedback to national authority representatives on the results. The Peaceful Change Initiative is an NGO that has been supporting societies to manage conflict during change, through increased capacities for dialogue, inclusion and collaboration and has already been conducting conflict mapping and analysis and community-level peacebuilding interventions in Libya.

",Informing and Empowering Communities: Early Warning and Action in Libya,"
As Libyan society moves beyond the revolution / civil conflict in 2011 a range of local fractures within society are becoming evident. In some cases these fractures are resulting in armed violence between communities, either geographic or interest-based. As the government struggles to reign in militias and ongoing violence in the country, much attention is being focused on the costal areas with little to no attention being paid to the southern part of the country. Although the revolution shifted the balance of local power dynamics, the transition has not altered the deeply rooted legacy of patronage politics, tribal manipulations, and underdevelopment that characterized four decades of Qadhafi’s rule. As a result, old issues and new dynamics are fueling a pervasive sense of marginalization, funneling conflict along communal fault lines, and fanning fears that opportunistic extremists will fill the space in search of a safe haven and smuggling routes.

These factures are in part driven by recent experiences during the revolution / civil conflict and in part by different aspirations for the future of Libya after the conflict. They are, however, also informed by longer-term issues, such as access to resources and historical relations between tribal and ethnic groups, and movements across Libya’s borders. This is especially the case in Southern Libya, where recent tensions are informed by longer-term structural conflict.  As such, there is a need to develop a differentiated approach to managing conflict in the North of the country and the South. In the South there is a need for greater investment in local capacity to monitor conflict dynamics and plan for their management through local resources. 

The Peaceful Change Initiative is a not-for-profit non-government organization whose mission is to support societies to manage conflict during change, through increased capacities for dialogue, inclusion and collaboration. They have been operational in Libya since 2012 and its activities in Libya are focused on: a) practical initiatives at the local level to improve human security and ensure development activities are conflict sensitive, and b) building Libya state and non-state capacity in this field.

This grant fits within an overall need for more effective leadership in conflict management among both national and non-government actors. Hence, this grant is also designed to contribute towards one of three outputs of PCi’s overall programming approach in Libya - ‘Effective Leadership in conflict management during the transition in Libya’ - Initiatives in select fragile communities improve human security, and are led by informed and enabled local leaders. PCi is and will be leveraging other donor resources for support for their overall program framework and will be receiving Swiss funding and there is possibility of other funding. These funding streams are complementary to this grant in particular.  

The overall purpose of this grant would be to empower border and conflict vulnerable communities, particularly in the South, to play a role in tracking tensions and preventing violence – and to do so in a manner that is relevant to the diverse and localized tensions. This action would help inform national level programs and policies for managing tensions and conflict prevention (as an essential pillar of long-term development).  

Pci would have three objectives under this grant (also referenced under the M&E Plan):

1.	  Identify local drivers of tensions and triggers for violence – through a participatory process with community leaders and ‘peacebuilders’ to agree tension and peace indicators on a disaggregated basis in the communities; supported by mentoring and training in managing tensions / conflict prevention. 

2.	  Inform and empower communities in early warning – through regular tracking of tensions against agreed indicators – jointly by partners, community leaders and national civil society. Importantly, the results of this tracking process will be distributed back to participating communities to ensure they are more informed.

3.	  Inform and empower communities in early action – through local-level initiatives to respond to the results of monitoring, supported through on-going facilitation, training and accompaniment. 

In addition to the above objectives and purpose, the Peaceful Change initiative will also use the process results to explore the potential for early warning and action interventions in the wider Sahal region. Local-authority interlocutors will be involved in community-led processes that are designed have an impact within the lifespan of the project. The project will also provide an entry point to potential further work on public capacity in this area, through consultation with the national authorities during project design and feedback to national authority representatives on the results.

The assumption is that the establishment of an early warning and action system in border and conflict vulnerable communities will help support and create a basis for local-level initiatives to respond and that local actors will be interested and engaged. Additionally, it is assumed that local authority representatives and national level actors have a vested interest in promoting stability.

",Networking in Tripoli: Libyan CSO Brownbag Events,"
Libyan civil society organizations remain at a nascent stage while events in the country demand immediate and coordinated action on the part of civil society. Since the revolution, many Libyan CSOs have made huge progress in terms of their ability to implement grants, and ambition to pursue positive goals during the transitional period. The recent creation of the CSIC has given Tripoli based CSOs a space in which to further develop and coordinate their activities, and the proposed monthly networking events would build on this by creating a regular forum for discussion around specific themes related to the transition.

The CSIC works to improve the impact of Libyan civil society organizations (CSOs) and their projects by providing them with office space equipped with furnishings and Internet connection, facilities to conduct events, a community of other CSOs, and programming to enhance their effectiveness.  

In addition to the features of the CSIC, a strong network of CSOs is an essential element for the development of an advanced society.  This is especially essential in the post-conflict period that Libya is currently experiencing. The CSIC not only works to advance the strength of Libyan CSOs, it also strives to create a sense of awareness and respect for the institution of civil society that was once absent during Libya’s period of dictatorship.  

In this activity, the CSIC strives to advance the impact of its member CSOs by facilitating a network of relationships that will strengthen both their individual and collective influence. The best way for these CSOs to create these relationships is through monthly networking events. These networking events will help establish relationships among member CSOs, NGOs, companies, and the Libyan government that further the role of civil society within our community.  

The CSIC will facilitate six networking events through March 2013 for its member CSOs, and other active CSOs within driving distance. Each networking event will last approximately 2.5 hours. These networking events will take place at the CSIC location in Tripoli. The CSIC venue is rented until the end of 2013, and after this period the building will either continue as the CSIC, or become a permanent base for a number of the CSIC members, NLF will ensure that the events will continue as planned in either of these scenarios.

In order to attract key actors, the networking events target a broad range of professionals and personalities. In addition to the CSOs themselves, other groups in attendance will include International Non-Governmental Organizations, Embassies, prominent businessmen and business community leaders, management of govt. owned corporations, members of the General National Congress, the High National Election Commission, Tripoli Council, Hay al Andulus Council, prominent community activists, and local mosque sheikhs and preachers.  

These organizations will also use these networking events to market their services throughout the professional community, allowing them to gain more support for their causes. For example, CSOs will gain access to General National Congress members, the High National Election Commission team, and government officials which would allow CSOs to advocate for their issues around the elections, transitional justice, national dialogue, and the constitution making process. The CSOs will furthermore be able to reach out to new communities and organizations, creating a wider base for potential programs in Tripoli and beyond.

The long-term benefit of these networking events includes the strengthening of the network of CSOs throughout Libya as this is the first occurrence of widespread civil society in over four decades. The long-term goals of the networking of Libyan CSOs, will also include the expansion of the legitimacy of their ability to achieve goals. Within the traditional Libyan tribal system, the importance of legitimacy is paramount.  The networking of these CSOs is the most productive method of increasing legitimacy based on communal and social capital that can only be achieved through the establishment of relationships.

Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

LTI is in the process of assessing the program’s ability to assist Libyan efforts to launch a National Dialogue at a local/regional and national level. Although there is general agreement that a national dialogue is needed in Libya and some common themes that should be discussed, currently initiatives are separate and potentially competing, with no defined national framework for the process. Libyan government officials and civil society are discussing how to bring the different initiatives under a common national framework and process, with the hope that an effective process could be implemented.  Additionally, registration for the elections of the constitutional drafting commission is underway and this body will need to understand public opinion on critical national issues to effectively draft Libya’s new constitution. The national dialogue process will need to be complimentary to and inform this process. 
 
In order to support a national dialogue process, LTI is seeking to hire an advisor, for a period of 3-6 months to assist with priority interventions with both civil society and government counterparts. Given the lack of framework and uncertain progress on the national dialogue process, the scope of work and individual tasks will remain broad and flexible to allow the program to plug in to priority areas as the situation evolves.  Potential work plan components include:

1.	Assessing and mapping the actors and processes for the national dialogue and identifying immediate opportunities for LTI engagement. 
2.	Conducting workshops and creating outreach materials for local civil society partners to allow them to better advocate for an inclusive national process and more effectively participate. 
3.	Advising government counterparts in structuring and implementing a national dialogue process.
4.	Preparing case studies and technical background papers on comparative policies regarding core topics planned for Libya’s national dialogue 
5.	Liaising and coordinating with other international community actors to assure that LTI activities are well-aligned with other ongoing and planned support.

This activity assumes that a comprehensive, inclusive, and effective national dialogue process will contribute to a successful and stable political transition in Libya.

",Step Up: Taking Feegli to the Tripoli Streets to Promote Positive Ways Forward,"
Following the highs of the end of the Qadhafi era and the immense expectations for the period that followed, there is a prevalent sense of disillusionment in Libya. The general public has now become cynical and pessimistic about the future of Libya, and negative conversation has become dominant.

This change in national morale has provided a platform for negativity, disenfranchisement, violence, distrust of the political and legal systems and deterioration in civil engagement.  By taking the conversation back to the streets, by spreading that conversation through film and by refocusing that conversation into a positive, forward looking “microphone” – all packaged in engaging and entertaining broadcasting – FEEGLI STREET is a chance to change the conversation into a more positive and forward thinking one.  It is a chance to re-engage the population in a process focusing on nation building and active citizenship.

The country is at a sensitive and dangerous time in its transition especially in the period leading up to the drafting of Libya’s constitution. In November, Tripoli saw its’ worst fighting since the liberation of the city which culminated in the killing of over 40 persons when residents held a peaceful rally in Gharghor against an outside militia that ended in the open firing on protesters. Tripolitanians rallied in a major effort to push out the non-Tripoli militias with some success.  

The time for FEEGLI STREET is especially ripe for today. INTAJ, previous grantee under TRIP065, would like to capitalize on that sentiment to move the dialogue forward to a more constructive place. Also, the success of FEEGLI under TRIP065 and the popularity of its host will provide a unique and recognizable medium to facilitate this conversation.

Intaj is a commercial production company established in 2012 by group of Libyan youth. Some of Intaj’s staff were members of the 212Group, which was founded during the revolution to support outreach on emerging issues during the revolution and shortly after the liberation. The group often does pro-bono or discounted work with civil society organizations on transition issues. Under TRIP065 - Shining the Spotlight on Key Issues and Informing the Debate thru Video, Intaj developed five PSAs focusing on transition related issues and promoted them through a newly created campaign and Facebook page called Feegli. To date, there are over 88,000 people following the page. Https://www.facebook.com/Feegli

The primary aim of FEEGLI STREET is to change the prevalence of negativity and hopelessness in the national conversation and the public’s outlook about Libya’s future. Under the umbrella of this primary aim and building upon Feegli’s, success, FEEGLI STREET takes the conversation to the Libyan public, specifically in Tripoli, to increase their sense of ownership and responsibility. It aims to:

1.   Diversify the voices being heard in the conversation about Libya’s future, by seeking to bring out positive thinking in different segments of society, focusing especially on women, ethnic minorities and youth;
2.   Refocus the topics of conversation, by engaging, on film and in comfortable
out-of-studio settings, groups of people expressing themselves and their thoughts on the issues that are most important in Libya now and are vital to a better future through the prism of constructive conversation and positive engagement instead of destructive criticism;
3.   Entertain people – one of the fundamental shortcomings of the prevalent media in Libya at the moment is that it takes itself too seriously and is not enjoyable to watch.  By focusing on discussing issues of nation building in natural, original and engaging ways intended to entertain, there is a better chance of impacting on the national psyche; and
4.   Capitalize on the recent popular movement in the Libyan streets following
the events in Tripoli, which has created a new layer of freedom of expression against oppression and has sparked a fresh discussion/conversation regarding the real obstacles and issues facing Libya today.


The desired outcome of FEEGLI STREET is to start and continue a conversation that is positive and motivating regarding how Libyans see Libya’s future. It is also about exploring how people feel about Libya’s current state. The conversation will start with the TV/online show and will continue online through social media (Facebook and twitter).
The main goals for this project are as follows:

a.   To access opinion of the grassroots and engaging them in  key issues;
b.   To shift  public conversation towards productive and positive thinking, with the aim of encouraging active citizenship; and
c.   To understand and document the key topical issues most concerning the public.

This activity assumes that raising awareness and stimulating discussion of key transition issues will contribute to constructive dialogue that promotes a peaceful political transition. It also assumes that Libya will maintain the recent momentum and make progress in implementing transition milestones over the next three to six months.

",HNEC in the Spotlight: Reaching Out through Social Media,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

On 16 July 2013, Libya’s General National Congress (GNC) passed what is the most crucial law in its year term in office, the law (the Election Law) governing the election of the Constitutional Drafting Committee. The Election Law sets forth the criteria for the electoral system, candidacy, and voting, which will determine who is able to participate in the constitution drafting and voting processes, and as the elections was appointed to take place end of October, the High Election Commission started the preparation on the implementation of the election law and begin accepting applications for the 60 member committee. In recent months, the lack of cooperation and action on the part of the GNC has undoubtedly harmed its credibility. Many people are increasingly disillusioned with political processes since the revolution, making the election of the ’60 committee’ even more important. 

While firm dates for polling have yet to be announced, HNEC opened candidate registration on October 6, and the deadline for the registration of candidates has been extended until the end of November. As HNEC has now been established as a permanent election office, they are working to simultaneously organize the constitutional elections, and build a long term structure and organizational capacity. Due to the short timeframes and difficulties in releasing funding, HNEC have requested assistance to support outreach and transparency, through the provision of Social Media support. The Head of the Media Department (Mr. Hossam), has requested assistance in this area, and this is being carried out already to a limited extent by Step by Step volunteers.

HNEC has invited Step by Step (the proposed grantee) to assist with social media outreach through the provision of volunteers and expertise. Ahmed Bahih – a founder of Step by Step, is the Head of the Creative Section at HNEC – and was instrumental in bringing the Step by Step volunteers to work in the HNEC. While this was an initially informal agreement, the HNEC has recently made a formal request to Step by Step to support with social media outreach through videos, photography and blogging. In this capacity Step by Step will work with the HNEC to take photos, supervise the social media pages and contribute to the HNEC website, and design videos summarizing HNEC’s work, and presenting information to the public in an open manner. 

This activity would support Step by Step to provide these services through the provision of stipends for a total of eight staff, as well as photographic and computer equipment to support the creation of high quality outreach materials. These services will be provided through the Constitutional Committee Elections, and leave behind equipment which would be used by Step by Step to implement future outreach and social media campaigns on this or other topics.

In the past, Step by Step have implemented TRIP054 with USAID in which they conducted an outreach campaign, and surveyed 4,000 Libyans in nine underserved, low-income neighborhoods of Tripoli and greater Tripoli, where provision of government services is limited to determine what they know about the constitution. But its members have been involved in many related activities funded by USAID/OTI and other donors, such as humanitarian aid projects, the Human Rights Film Festival, and civic education campaigns. Step by Step works in particularly close collaboration with the Free Media Center, a former LTI grantee. The center was instrumental in Step by Step's establishment, with some members belonging to both organizations and the center continues to provide Step by Step with office space. 

Step by Step were also provided with two high quality cameras and one Mac Book Pro under a TRIP054. This equipment would continue to be used on this project alongside the other equivalent equipment which is requested through this activity. While the equipment is similar in nature, the scale of this activity is such that both new and old equipment will be in simultaneous use to monitor and report on HNEC activities in various parts of the country. New equipment being purchased is of a similar standard to allow for the maximum compatibility with equipment previously purchased under TRIP054.

Given the HNEC’s bureaucratic procedures which could slow the progress of any activity, this grant will provide Step by Step with the equipment and stipends needed to help them achieve their mission with HNEC, this will also increase their capacity for continued efforts to support the political transition. HNEC is also being supported by IFES for their media center for the elections, and this activity would complement the expertise provided by IFES on traditional media, but providing both content and further outreach through social media and informational materials.

This activity assumes that supporting Step by Step to conduct social media outreach for the HNEC will help increase access to information, opportunities for civil society/government engagement, and help promote inclusive implementation of the constitution drafting assembly elections.

",Prioritizing Community Improvements and Community Security in Tripoli,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust towards government.  

As the political, economic and cultural capital of Libya, the stability and security of Tripoli are of paramount importance to the Libyan transition. Events in Tripoli have knock on effects around the country, and as a result, the city has become a central focus area in which power games between different factions are played out.

In spite of this, Tripoli itself continues to suffer from the legacy of decades of under investment and service delivery, creating issues not just in terms of national level processes, but also through local events which affect the population of the city. Power, fuel and water shortages in recent months have all served to highlight the lack of ability of the government to provide essential services, and mitigate against shocks, even in the capital city of the country.

While militia presence in the city has been greatly reduced since the massacre of protesting civilians at Gharghour, the city still suffers from chronic insecurity, with the nascent National Army able to provide only a limited presence on major thoroughfares of the city. Citizens of Tripoli have shown their willingness to stand up against militias and push for a country with legitimate security institutions, however their efforts must be supported by local civil society and governance initiatives if they are to succeed on a long term basis. As such, the lack of inclusive local civil society organizations and effective local governance are a key area of focus. 

LTI is currently in the process of ramping up and looking for programmatic opportunities in Tripoli itself which to date has been more focused on Tripoli CSOs who work on national level issues rather than programming in Tripoli for the sake of Tripoli. Therefore, LTI looks to support catalytic community improvement that builds government legitimacy and boosts community security.

o	  Boosting government legitimacy and community activism through high visibility community improvement projects. These efforts would particularly target either high profile locations or targeted communities.
o	  Engaging with moderate voices (including media, CSO leaders, and dialogue initiatives that seek to build constructive links across a broad range of groups).
o	  Targeting youth – identifying and prioritizing activities to engage youth in the transition through activities both targeting and lead by youth in Tripoli.
o	  Development of civil society advocacy and conflict mitigation networks (community watch groups, security liaison forums, anti-weapons advocacy, etc.)
o	  Support creative initiatives that capture attention, generate buzz, and spark engagement in transition processes.

In response to the evolving situation, LTI is increasing its’ programming in Tripoli, with a particular focus on the two key areas of Suq al Juma, and Tajoura. This STTA will contribute to program development by working with local communities in these areas to identify and prioritize activities which contribute to community improvement and community security.

",Generating Momentum: Stratcomm Support for the Prime Minister's Office,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

Given the deep-seated history of suspicion and the widespread current frustration with the pace of political transition, effective communication by government is necessary to boost confidence in the process and build legitimacy of these nascent institutions. The Prime Minister’s office has created a strategic communications division to increase the public’s understanding of the government’s policies and actions. While enhanced communication is an urgent priority due to the increasingly volatile political and security trends, the Office of Strategic Communications is constrained by limited staff and capacity. In meeting with the U.S. Embassy, the Prime Minister requested focused expert technical assistance to improve the capacity of the strategic communication’s office to produce and coordinate consistent media messaging and public outreach. As a result, LTI will provide material and logistical assistance for a strategic communication advisor who will be embedded in the Office of Strategic Communications for approximately two and a half months. 

M&C Saatchi is a global communications and advertising firm based in London. M&C Saatchi World Services is a specialist division of the organization that focuses on international diplomatic and development sectors. A team of M&C Saatchi advisors is currently working in Libya to provide marketing and media support to the Warrior’s Affairs Commission. 

This activity assumes that more effective media and public outreach by the Office of the Prime Minister will boost the credibility of government authorities as well as increase public confidence in the political transition.

This  grant aims to support the Warrior Affairs Commission (WAC) in the design of an institutional  reform and capacity development strategy and plan, the design of a reintegration  strategy, and the  provision  of targeted technical assistance for program implementation of two of the four program areas, namely economic reintegration and political reintegration through the provision of technical advisors over the course of five months. In addition, support will be provided to WAC’s public information and communication strategy and implementing capacities, as well as to WAC’s contribution to disarmament and arms control through the new commission under the Prime Minister. Lastly, an initial gender strategy will be drafted. Failure to address the special requirements of Thwar will have long-term consequences for sustainable development, compound the conditions for instability and threaten the peace process.  The  WAC, as a government  agency, is in a unique position of being able to significantly reduce tensions and transform the leaders of the revolution into civilian leaders thereby contributing constructively to the development of the new Libya.

",Reinvigorating WAC: Supporting Institutional Capacity and Strategic Development,"
The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates implementation of the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. Continued assassinations and open hostility to government authorities by spoilers in the east, kidnapping of the Prime Minister, and open clashes between militias in the middle of Tripoli are only some of the more recent examples of a government unable to get ahold of security in the country. 

In October 2011, the NTC declared the establishment of the Warriors Affairs Commission (WAC), with the aim of registering all armed and non-­-armed fighters who participated in fighting against the Qadhafi regime, and to build a comprehensive database with their contact information, technical skills and educational   background.   These   individuals   range   from   those   who   fought   during   the revolution (considered ‘real’ Thuwar), to those who participated in some degree or another during the revolution and the released political prisoners. The overall goal of WAC is to reintegrate these individuals. It has designed  nine  different  reintegration  projects  in  four  program  areas  namely  political,  economic, social  and educational  reintegration  and has a component  on integration  into the national  police  or army and higher education. The (re)integration effort is on an individual basis and not on a brigade basis as this approach should help diminish the power base of the brigades and ensure a transition to national security  forces,  and  the  state  taking  more  control  and  ownership  of  the  responsibility  for  national security.
 
Based upon earlier work with the Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) in Libya, this grant will contain a number of essential activities which are urgent, timely and relevant in order to kick-­-start  the DDR program and thus directly contributing stabilization and transformation of Libya. The War Affairs Commission (WAC) has a clear mandate and vision, as outlined in the National Transition Council Decree Number 60. On the basis of this and other vision statements developed by WAC, this grant will assist WAC in developing a clearly defined reintegration strategy. A key next-­-step will be to assess the different levels of current WAC capacities to implement the strategy, to develop a capacity development plan and to provide initial support to kick-­- start some of the most essential activities. 

USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (USAID/OTI) launched the Libya Transition Initiative in July 2011 to support Libyan efforts to build an inclusive and accountable democratic government that reflects the will and needs of the Libyan people. Among other burning issues, Libya is facing enormous challenges in terms of reconciliation.  As  part  of  their  leadership  program,  WAC’s  vision  is  to  create  a  pool  of Thuwar leaders that can become advocates for peace and dialogue, and who can be trained to become mediators in local conflicts. In the framework of this, LTI brought in the expertise of Irma Specht, Director  of Transition  International  (TI) under BENG014,  to design  and  deliver  a total  of eight  training  workshops  in various locations across Libya. The objective of the workshops was to develop the individual capacities of selected Thuwar leaders in conflict resolution, non-­-violent communication and mediation skills. As a follow-­-up  to this successful activity, advanced level training will take place in December 2013, under BENG045, to further build the capacities of the most promising mediators among the 240 people trained, and to support the creation of a pool of mediators that can be employed to effectively mediate conflicts in Libya. They will be assisted to start one or several NGOs, as part of WACs program to stimulate Thuwar playing a role in civil society. By supporting individual capacity building of selected leaders, LTI is aiming to contribute to transforming conflicts or potential conflicts in Libya into more inclusive and peaceful contexts.

For WAC this effort is part of a broader leadership program investing in the Thuwar commanders to become effective civilian leaders in different sectors of society and agents for change. This broader leadership program in particular has the potential to reduce tensions and to serve as an example for other commanders, such as those still engaged in violence through the shields and militias, to join the Warriors Affairs Commission (WAC) program that is providing opportunities to Thuwar to fulfill better positions in Libyan society.

In working with WAC, it became evident that the organization needs support from both national and international actors to be able to fulfill its mandate in the most effective and timely manner. For this to
become feasible, it was necessary to start a process of capacity assessment of WAC in order to identify its strengths, its weaknesses and the areas of support required.

As an initial step, Transition International (TI) was engaged through LTI, under BENG040, to facilitate a self-­-analysis of the program implementation capacities of the WAC and the review of the effectiveness of its reintegration efforts, which took place in a workshop in Djerba, Tunisia in September 2013.

WAC currently has four programs and each includes several projects. These are:  Economic   reintegration (SMEs, vocational   training); Political participation   (leadership, summer camps, civil society); Social reintegration (psycho-­-social support, getting married) and Education support (higher education, English language courses).  These programs were assessed throughout the 4.5 day workshop. The assessment was designed in such a way as to:

•	  Help WAC senior management to better understand current capacities and identify areas where the support is needed both from the GoL and from other internal and external partners.
•	  Support WAC senior management to take a step back, outside the stressful environment of day-­- to-­-day management, and reflect on current challenges they are facing and on how they could improve their teamwork spirit and start to deliver more effectively.

A matrix with the strength and weaknesses of WACs programming capacities was developed and  presented in Tripoli in a large meeting for international actors, donors and selected Government representatives.

WAC needs support in reviewing and redrafting the structure of the organization, review its HR and needs technical support to further design their programs and to boost effective implementation.  Furthermore, it  needs  to create more effective  linkages  to enable delivery  of its mandate  in the most effective  manner  and within a limited period of time.

The proposed activities will take place over a short period of 5 months will seriously contribute to kick start the DDR program in Libya. This grant aims to contribute to Libya’s peaceful transition and to support the broader peacebuilding efforts taking place within the country by improving the reintegration process of the Warrior Affairs Commission. Technical experts will be provided over five months and will work with WAC to conduct an institutional capacity assessment, propose a capacity development strategy, develop reintegration and disarmament strategies, and provide program strategy and implementation support. Failure to address the special requirements of Thwar will have long-­- term consequences for sustainable development, compound the conditions for instability and threaten the peace process.  The  WAC,  as  a  Government  Agency,  is  in  a  unique  position  of  being  able  to significantly reduce tensions and transform the leaders of the revolution into civilian leaders thereby contributing constructively to the development of the new Libya.  It therefore plays a pivotal role in the Libyan transition.  It is therefore likely to have immediate effect on reinforcing national reconciliation and identity. 

The assumption is that if WAC becomes more effective and transparent in its delivery, it will furthermore improve government’s legitimacy and stability in the country.

USAID, through its Libya Transition Initiative (LTI), has been a major contributor to the transition process and has played a small, but much appreciated, role in supporting the WAC. This activity aims to build upon the established positive relationship and work already undertaken by LTI in Libya through the assessment and support of the WAC and is in line with LTIs wider objectives of assisting the Libyan-­-led efforts to promote national unity and the transition to inclusive democracy.

This activity aims to promote inclusive participation in the upcoming Constitution Development Assembly (CDA) elections by supporting a rapid public outreach campaign to encourage voter registration in Tripoli. The six-day campaign will seek to distribute outreach material, raise awareness about registration, and boost turnout by supporting outreach buses that will tour Tripoli and mobilization tents that will be set up in key neighborhoods. The legitimacy of the CDA elections is being jeopardized by the low level of voter registration, particularly in Tripoli -- Libya’s capital and population center -- and among youth. Working in close coordination with the High National Elections Commission (HNEC), the campaign will be led by Momken, a youth-led civil society organization that has engaged in several political awareness campaigns and seeks to implement activities with average Libyans on the street.

",Register Now! Supporting HNEC Outreach on Constitution Committee Elections,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

On 16 July 2013, the GNC passed the election law for the Constitution Drafting Assembly. Candidate registration began in October, and the High National Elections Commission (HNEC) published an initial list of 698 candidates on December 7. HNEC launched SMS voter registration on December 1, initially setting a two week deadline for the process. As of December 14, only 320,000 people have registered, well below the 2.7 million people who registered for the GNC elections in July 2012. Widespread uncertainty about the process and frustration with the transition seem to be resulting in low interest in the elections and sluggish turnout for voter registration. 

HNEC’s public awareness campaigns started late and have not yet reached a broad audience. During a meeting on December 5 with Hussam Zagaar, HNEC’s Public Awareness and Outreach Director, HNEC’s Tripoli office was cited as an example of the practical challenges on the ground: the office has one person who is working to conduct outreach activities across the entire capital. HNEC said that leveraging and mobilizing the Libya Transition Initiatives (LTI) civil society network would greatly help compensate for HNEC’s minimal staffing capacity and ensure that material reaches a large audience rapidly. HNEC also said that greater efforts needed to be placed on reaching people with special needs and encouraging women to participate. LTI is already providing support for HNEC’s social media outreach (TRIP089).

During the meeting, LTI and HNEC talked about ways to quickly support outreach efforts through LTI’s partner network, particularly the information centers and upcoming events, to help HNEC distribute outreach material that has already been printed, HNEC also explained that they would be very interested in having some of our partners produce creative public service announcements or conduct voter registration mobilization events that target neighborhoods in Tripoli. As a result, LTI contacted a group of active, youth-led CSOs in Tripoli, including Momken, Phoenix, and Nawasi Alkheer.  Momken is an offshoot from Alleqa, which previously implemented TRIP015, an awareness campaign using buses in Tripoli for mass public outreach during the GNC elections. As Alleqa activities grew in scope, some members established a new organization named Momken that is focused more on political awareness through technology and media related programs to engage Libyan public - particularly youth - in the transition. 

In a meeting that gathered all three CSOs and the head of Students Union of Engineering Faculty, LTI discussed the idea of rapid TRIP015-style campaign and ways of coordinating quick grassroots outreach among these partners. The partners agreed that a street-level voter registration outreach surge was critical. In coordination with HNEC and the other organizations, Momken will lead a ‘bus tour’ outreach campaign, where vehicles equipped with loud speakers and decorated with outreach slogans will tour neighborhoods and distribute HNEC material. The neighborhoods will include Martyrs Square, Nufleen, Zaweyat Addahmani, Ben Ashour, Madena, Abu Salim, Hadba, Ein Zara, Tajoura, and Janzour. 
The five female leaders of Phoenix will volunteer to visit schools, and Nawasi AlKheer will focus on the camps for displaced communities. 

This activity assumes that supporting Momken and its civil society partners to implement this outreach campaign will increase opportunities for citizen to participate in the CDA elections and engage with the government on the development of a new constitution.

",Publicizing the National Dialogue in Libya thru Strategic Communications Support,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

Amid political uncertainty and continued insecurity, Libya is launching a national dialogue process. There has been a broad popular and political push for a comprehensive and inclusive national dialogue process on key issues in order to promote reconciliation, reinforce national unity, and reinvigorate the transition. After several previous competing efforts by various political factions failed to gain traction, on January 15 Fadeel Lameen, Chairman of the National Dialogue Preparatory Commission, officially launched the government mandated national dialogue initiative. Over the next two months, the National Dialogue Preparatory Commission will focus on two main priorities: (1) outreach and education to inform people across the country about the process, and (2) consultations to build consensus around a framework of principles that will shape and guide the process going forward. The current plan is to hold a national conference at the end of March/early April that will enshrine these principles, consolidate support around the process, and set the next stage for conducting national dialogues on substantive issues that are yet to be agreed upon (e.g. security, national identity, etc.). 

Fadeel Lameen has requested strategic communications support from the Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) during the early phases of the processes as he attempts to raise awareness and build buy in for the initiative. The core objective of the National Dialogue strategic communications campaign will be to build consensus and unity across diverse segments of Libyan society while strengthening civil society institutions and enhancing the legitimacy of the central government in Tripoli. 

As a result, this activity will provide a team of senior communications professionals from Bell Pottinger who will offer strategic direction, communications campaign planning, and public relations support to to the National Dialogue Preparatory Commission for a period of six weeks. Bell Pottinger’s senior team will begin strategic planning of the National Dialogue communications campaign by reviewing existing opinion research, clarifying communications objectives, and devising a strategy and subsequent set of appropriate communications tactics to target segmented audiences with a special emphasis on non-traditional means to reach hard to access demographics including rural populations and youth. Bell Pottinger will help Lameen’s office develop a core set of narrative, monitor media coverage, develop more effective and efficient communications processes, design a National Dialogue Communications Strategy, and implement a strategic communications campaign in the outreach and consultation period prior to the National Conference.

Bell Pottinger is a communications firm with extensive experience providing high-level technical assistance with strategic communications campaigns to governments in complex political transition environments.  

This activity assumes that a comprehensive, inclusive, and effective national dialogue process will contribute to a successful and stable political transition in Libya.

",Votes That Count: Elections Monitoring in the Nafusa Mountains,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

After long delays and much uncertainty, the GNC decided on February 06, 2013 to hold popular elections for the committee that will draft Libya’s post-revolution constitution. The law to elect the committee was approved by the GNC on July 16. Under the election law, the 60-member committee will be composed of 20 members from each of the nation’s three regions – East, West, and South. Six seats will be allocated for women, and three minority groups – Tuareg, Tebu, and Amazigh -- will each receive two seats. The High National Elections Committee (HNEC) is responsible for preparing the election, including voter registration, candidate registration, and developing the mechanisms to implement the election law. Elections are expected to be held towards the end of February 2014.

Elections are contentious in the Nafusa mountains region, with the Amazigh ethnic community expected to boycott the vote, in protest against the small number of allocated seats they have been given, and the lack of official recognition of Amazigh language and culture. In order to promote a transparent and inclusive process as far as possible, Shohada Horia are organizing elections monitoring training in Rojban, a central town in the Nafusa mountains. While the town is predominantly Arab, the grantee will invite both Amazigh and Arab representatives, to encourage Amazigh representatives to participate away from the stigma of their local communities. The grantee has received training from the HNEC, to ensure that the training will represent best practice in elections monitoring in Libya.

After the training, the grantee will organize elections monitoring in several towns in the Nafusa mountains, including – if possible – in Amazigh communities. This will seek to ensure that whatever the participation in the elections, these are documented in a systematic manner, which gives an objective view of electoral participation – or lack thereof – in the Nafusa mountains region.

This activity assumes that by conducting training and elections monitoring activities, trust and transparency on the constitutional elections will be increased. This activity furthermore assumes that an open and transparent process will contribute to increased legitimacy and trust in the constitutional drafting process.

",Moderate Voices: Support for Ghadames Newspaper,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

Ghadames is an ancient town on the border of Libya, Tunisia and Algeria. Originally a trading post and oasis frequented by cross desert caravans, the town retains a distinct cultural identity based around a strong sense of both Libyan nationalism and Amazigh culture. The town is one of the only Amazigh centers which are not boycotting the Constitutional Drafting Assembly elections, and local residents consider themselves a moderating influence on the Amazigh community.

Tofarda media group is run by a local youth who publish the 16 page “Ghadames Newspaper” every two weeks. The team are self-taught in journalism through online and on the job training, and cover key transitional topics such as the constitution, elections, youth and women's issues. The newspaper is currently distributed in in Tripoli, Zawia, Khoms, Zliten, Misurata, Gharian, Bani Walid, Weddan, Derj, and Senaow. The team plan to expand their distribution to include other cities in the Nafusa Mountain.

Like many newly established media outlets, the newspaper initially struggled for financial reasons, which resulted in a pause of publishing for almost a year. During this time the team searched for new ways to resume publishing, and this led to establishing a cooperation with Ghadames local council. The council is currently providing support through: office space for the team, costs for in some employee expenses, and facilitating arrangements in terms of permissions and official letters as needed. In return the team is documenting the council’s events and provides some archiving and media advice to the council. The council has requested the team also film some council activities and general events in the city for the council and paper's facebook pages, and other media outlets.

This activity will support the ongoing production of Ghadames newspaper as a moderate Amazigh voice in the Nafusa mountains region. By providing a suite of equipment which will increase the professionalism of the staff, the activity will also support Ghadames Newspaper in becoming increasingly independent by diversifying their funding sources. The Tofarda team have committed to publishing a minimum of two articles per paper which relate to key transitional issues, including activities that LTI support within that region, in addition to providing a detailed plan of their distribution in the Nafusa Mountains. It is anticipated that a future regional grant will focus on training for journalists across the Nafusa mountain region, and this will likely include staff from Ghadames Newspaper, to ensure the benefit of their new equipment is maximized to the fullest extent possible.

As a result of previous experience gained from TRIP039, and through discussions with the Tofarda team, it is agreed that LTI will monitor the content of the newspaper to ensure it is in line with professional norms and LTI’s objective of promoting a credible and stable transition in Libya. If LTI believes there are significant issues with the content of the paper, this will be discussed with the grantee, and as a final measure, LTI reserves the right to withhold the deeding of equipment to the paper. LTI is also working to develop a journalistic training program which will include members of Ghadames newspaper when it takes place.

This activity assumes that by supporting Ghadames Newspaper as a reliable and moderate news source, it will promote increased trust and tolerance between different communities in the Nafusa Mountains and across Libya.

The High National Elections Committee (HNEC) is responsible for preparing the election, including voter registration, candidate registration, and developing the mechanisms to implement the election law. Elections are expected to be held towards the end of February 2014.

Given that the majorities of Libyans under age 60 years old have never participated in an election nor lived in a democratic society, there is a significant lack of knowledge about the role of elections observers in a democratic system. In order to address this need, LNPD has organized electoral observers, providing training and organization in coordination with NDI. 

Election day will be a very visible and visual experience for Libyans. The identification and prominence of election monitors at the polling stations will reinforce the legitimacy and value of the election process. This activity will provide high visibility vests to all elections observers, to ensure that they are readily identifiable to the population as they monitor the election, promoting transparency and engagement of the Libyan population.

This activity assumes that by supporting elections monitoring activities, trust and transparency on the constitutional elections will be increased. This activity furthermore assumes that an open and transparent process will contribute to increased legitimacy and trust in the constitutional drafting process.

",Looking at the Bigger Picture: Short-Term Mapping Support in Libya,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

Quality mapping products are a necessary program tool that enables LTI to make informed decisions in this rapidly evolving and complex operating environment. The ability to visualize activities and analysis is also critical in helping LTI report to a wide array of stakeholders. This activity will enable the GIU’s GIS specialist to come to Libya for a three - four week follow-up visit. Specially, this grant will primarily provide essential logistical and operational support for the trip, such as lodging and transportation expenses. The GIS specialist will focus on supporting a number of mapping deliverables and will focus on the following SOW objectives: 

•  	Systematize and augment current geographic and thematic areas for mapping and data visualization for the LTI program.
•	  Help streamline integration of new data streams and assist LTI with increased mapping and data visualization needs during the program’s expansion.
•	  Train appropriate staff on basic mapping opportunities and tools for field data collection; work closely with relevant staff on more advanced tools for mapping and GIS data management.
•	  Collaborate and coordinate with the field team to create a list of desired maps and products for the immediate and long-term needs of the program.

The outputs of this activity will directly feed into LTI’s decision making, reporting, and monitoring and evaluation. The mapping specialist will be see how LTI’s mapping initiatives could potentially be leveraged to support ongoing technical and policy processes. The specialist will also help LTI evaluate new ideas that involve GIS, such as support for conflict early warning systems. The activity assumes that the GIS specialist will be able to accumulate a sufficient amount of reliable data in order to produce the anticipated deliverables.

",High Visibility: Utilizing Media Engagement & Communications to Leverage Impact,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts.

In response to these trends, LTI is implementing clusters of visible, tangible community improvement projects that help to boost government legitimacy, bolster community security, and spark local-level change. By bringing together local authorities, civil society, and the private sector to deliver practical projects like community parks and football fields, these activities aim to build relationships among key stakeholders and improve confidence in the transition. The projects seek to empower moderate voices to ‘Think Nationally, Act Locally,” strengthen local resiliencies that reject extremism, and promote conflict-sensitive local development. To maximize impact, LTI will work with local partners to ensure that there is a media plan in place to publicize and promote the projects.

Additionally, In order to support more responsive, effective, and transparent government institutions, LTI is providing embedded technical assistance at the request of government authorities. By helping government officials in areas like strategic communications and strategic planning, this technical assistance seeks to provide catalytic support to improve immediate functioning during a critical period while also contributing to longer-term capacity development. LTI is currently providing strategic communications assistance to the Office of the Prime Minister (TRIP091) and the National Dialogue Preparatory Commission (TRIP094). 

Media engagement and communications are an essential component of a range of LTI activities. The Media Advisor will work with LTI staff and partners to design a strategic plan, develop capacity, and incorporate an effective media component into community improvement activities. The Media Advisor will also promote coordination among these technical assistance initiatives, as well as ensure that high-level strategic communication support is leveraging local-level community improvement activities.

This activity assumes that increasing the visibility of community improvement projects and other related initiatives will enhance their impact in bolstering public confidence in the transition, boosting government legitimacy, and building better linkages between communities and state authorities.

The grant will provide the Baladi boxing club with sports equipment and refurbishment work that will enable the club to offer boxing lessons and host events that promote leadership skills, conflict resolution techniques, and other related activities. Youth in Tripoli are an under-served population with little access to recreational activities and a lack of positive role models. One of the oldest and most popular sports clubs in Tripoli, the Baladi boxing club will be a strong partner and platform for providing youth with an alternative to destabillzing behavior.

",Boxing for Peace! Supporting Youth Engagement Through Boxing.,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust toward government.  

As the political, economic and cultural capital of Libya, the stability and security of Tripoli are of paramount importance to the Libyan transition. Events in Tripoli have knock on effects around the country, and as a result, the city has become a central focus area in which power games between different factions are played out. In spite of this, Tripoli itself continues to suffer from the legacy of decades of under investment and service delivery, creating issues not just in terms of national level processes, but also through local events which affect the population of the city. Power, fuel and water shortages in recent months have all served to highlight the lack of ability of the government to provide essential services, and mitigate against shocks, even in the capital city of the country.

Youth in Tripoli are an under-served population, with few outlets for recreational activities, and a lack of positive role models for participating in the development of Libya. The youth played a key part in the revolution, however the proliferation of weapons, use of drugs and alcohol, and other forms of anti-social behavior mean that there is concern over the potential role of youth populations as spoilers, or as potential contributors to crime or violence. There are increasing concerns that extremist influences are gaining a foothold in areas around Tripoli and are likely to expand into the capital. Working with youth is consistently identified by Libyan ministries, CSOs and the youth themselves as a key focus area to support a peaceful transition.

At the end of 2011, a Boxing Technical Committee was established by the Libyan Olympic committee, and currently consists of around 150 members. The committee organizes competitions around Libya, and has branches in many cities, including Tripoli, Misurata, Sabha, Khoms, etc. This activity will work with a local boxing club in the Umar Mukhtar St. area of downtown Tripoli to provide positive youth activities and role models through the sport of boxing. Boxing was abandoned as an official sport during the rule of Qhadafi, and was even forbidden in an official resolution by the General Committee of Sport under the old regime. 

Baladi Boxing Club occupies a space which was previously occupied by Muttasim Qhadafi, however at that time only Mutassim and his associates were allowed to use the club. The grantee was introduced to LTI by Naziha Arebi, the filmmaker working with LTI on TRIP070, the club featured in her film “Between the Ropes”, which highlighted the development of the sport of Boxing in Libya.

The club currently offers free classes for youth participants, and recently opened the door for female participants. This activity aims to increase the club capacity to support positive change and engage at-risk youth through the political transition. This activity would provide the club with a suite of equipment to allow the team to continue and develop their training in a professional manner. The equipment would be delivered in two stages, the first tranche of equipment would be delivered as soon as possible, and the second would be delivered later, as the grantee is looking to use the provision of the initial equipment as a means of leveraging a better – and currently vacant – building on the same site. If the improved building is not available (the grantee believes he will gain the necessary permission), a more limited second stage would still be delivered to make the best use of the current space. In either case, LTI would also provide limited maintenance and refurbishment for the available space. 

Finally, this activity will also include a range of activities for youth which will be developed with the grantee - delivered on a bi-weekly basis with participants – related to conflict resolution, leadership skills, etc. LTI will be engaging both national and international advisers on youth activities, and this is expected to feed into the ongoing activities which will be conducted with Baladi boxing club.

This activity assumes that supporting sport clubs in Tripoli will help support positive productive youth activities which provide positive role models and engage at risk populations in the Libyan transition.

Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

In January 2014, the National Dialogue Preparatory Commission (NPDC) announced the launch of a new initiative to promote reconciliation, reinforce national unity, and reinvigorate the transition through comprehensive discussions on important social, political, and security issues. Although it is in its early stages, the national dialogue process has emerged as significant transition priority. LTI is providing technical assistance with civil society engagement, strategic communications, and other areas as requested.

Over the next several months, the NDPC will focus on two main priorities: (1) outreach and education to inform people across the country about the process, and (2) consultations to build consensus around a framework of principles that will shape and guide the process going forward. In March, the NDPC -- with critical strategic communications support from Bell Pottinger -- conducted an outreach and engagement tour in 22 cities across Libya. 8 cities remain on the initial itinerary, and the NDPC is contemplated a second phase that would cover an additional 20 cities. The NDPC received feedback from communities that will help tailor and target subsequent messaging campaigns. The NDPC plans to hold a national conference that will enshrine these principles in a National Dialogue charter, consolidate support around the process, and set the next stage for conducting national dialogues on substantive issues that are yet to be agreed upon (e.g. security, national identity, etc.). 

Fadeel Lameen has requested strategic communications support from the Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) during the early phases of the processes as he attempts to raise awareness and build buy in for the initiative. The first phase of this support (under TRIP094) helped to support this initiative and the national launch of the process. The core objective of the National Dialogue strategic communications campaign will be to build consensus and unity across diverse segments of Libyan society while strengthening civil society institutions and enhancing the legitimacy of the central government in Tripoli. 

As a result of positive feedback from the NDPC under the first phase, this activity will provide a team of senior communications professionals from Bell Pottinger who will offer strategic direction, communications campaign planning, and public relations support to the National Dialogue Preparatory Commission for a period an additional period of eight weeks. Bell Pottinger’s senior team will continue strategic planning of the National Dialogue communications campaign by reviewing existing opinion research, clarifying communications objectives, and devising a strategy and subsequent set of appropriate communications tactics to target segmented audiences with a special emphasis on non-traditional means to reach hard to access demographics including rural populations and youth. Bell Pottinger will help Lameen’s office develop a core set of narrative, monitor media coverage, develop more effective and efficient communications processes, design a National Dialogue Communications Strategy, and implement a strategic communications campaign in the outreach and consultation period prior to the National Conference. 

Bell Pottinger is a communications firm with extensive experience providing high-level technical assistance with strategic communications campaigns to governments in complex political transition environments.  

This activity assumes that a comprehensive, inclusive, and effective national dialogue process will contribute to a successful and stable political transition in Libya.

",Kicking for Peace! Football and Dialogue in Ghadames.,"
Two years into Libya's tenuous political transition, there is declining confidence in government institutions, severe strains on national unity, and a critical need for practical initiatives that promote reconciliation. A national dialogue to bring together Libyan political, social, and economic leaders to devise a political vision for the future of the country is critical at this time. While the government has been slow to take the lead, civil society can play a catalytic role, and creative arts produced by moderate voices are an excellent way to broach these highly sensitive topics of reconciliation and national unity.

While the constitution has yet to be written, and countless pieces of legislation face delays, it does not mean the effort for a united Libya has to freeze until the right procedures are in place for accountability and justice. Themes of reconciliation can be promoted, albeit in a sensitive and indirect manner given the frustrations of Libyans by delays in the transitional justice process which many consider must take place before reconciliation is to be achieved. Therefore the issue and the word reconciliation will not even be mentioned within this activity; it will be more about challenging Libyans to consider their own diversity and inspiring a feeling of unity and identity through shared traditions.

Recently many Libyan NGOs and production companies striving for positive change are utilizing creative methods to promote unity and reconciliation among frustrated, and at times resentful, citizens, especially in some key areas of a marginalized groups such as the Amazigh. The Libyan national team recently won the African Championship in a middle of many political disappointments, and all Libyan cities participated in the celebrations. The Ghadames Veterans League believes that sport is a way to unite society and build a sense of national unity. They aim to create a healthy competitive environment, promote dialogue and build a bridge of communication and trust among the Nafusa Mountain cities.

Ghadames Veterans League was established in 2010 by a group of the athletes in Libya. These athletes were ex-players and trainers in the Al-Somoud culture, social and sport club; one of the oldest clubs in Libya, created during the Italian colonial period in 1934. The club was a place for sports and social activities, including: football, basketball, volleyball and some public traditional (Gadamesi) games such as Shasha ball, a game that is similar to rugby.

LTI are providing grantee with equipment and maintenance needed for the league to bring together around 104 football players for a one week tournament and related dialogue discussions. The activity includes presentations using materials from the TRIP067 kits, along with organizing at least four lectures and open discussions on topics related to the national dialogue.

This activity assumes that organizing football tournament that gathers people from a number of cities in the Nafusa Mountains and beyond will create a healthy competitive environment, that will stimulate discussion and will contribute to constructive dialogue that promotes a peaceful political transition.

There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

As the political, economic and cultural capital of Libya, the stability and security of Tripoli are of paramount importance to the Libyan transition. Events in Tripoli have knock on effects around the country, and as a result, the city has become a central focus area in which power games between different factions are played out. Citizens of Tripoli have shown their willingness to stand up against militias and push for a country with legitimate political and security institutions, however their efforts must be supported by local civil society and governance initiatives if they are to succeed on a long term basis. As such, support for civic activism and supporting moderate voices remain a key area of focus both for Tripoli itself, and for the country as a whole.

In order to counter the destabilizing trend of public disengagement, LTI is providing catalytic support to enable civil society to effectively participate in political processes as well as creating opportunities to impact their communities through “Thinking Nationally, Act Locally” initiatives. LTI is engaging politically marginalized and conflict vulnerable groups, and build their linkages with local and national government. To promote inclusive and informed participation in key political processes, LTI is supporting initiatives that raise awareness on critical issues, create opportunities for civil society to engage with government, and empower effective advocacy.

UNDP has invited Funoon (the proposed grantee) to assist with design and media outreach for their “Distour Libya” online constitutional drafting portal. Funoon will provide media design services ranging from website and social media designs, video PSAs, and printed materials. Funoon have already commenced providing this support to UNDP informally (including developing the logo, color palate, and website designs). To increase the quality and speed of this support, UNDP and Funoon have also asked for support from LTI in the form of technical equipment, to ensure a high quality of service delivery, and enough resources to take on all aspects of the project. In this capacity, Funoon will work with the UNDP to provide creative design for the website and social media, film a number of PSAs related to the project and the constitution in general, and take photos and videos for the UNDP constitutional drafting portal. This will create buzz both around the UNDP constitutional drafting project, but also for the constitution as a whole. 

This activity would support Funoon to provide these services through the provision of photographic and computer equipment to support the creation of high quality outreach materials. These services will be provided to the UNDP project, and will leave Funoon with a high quality suite of equipment, which would be used by them to implement future outreach and social media campaigns on this or other topics. The graphic and video designers at Funoon have shown their ability through grants with LTI, and working with Libyan authorities such as the Ministry of Local Government. The group’s enthusiasm and drive to promote the constitutional drafting process highlights their commitment to supporting this key political process at a time when public engagement is decreasing.

This activity assumes that supporting Funoon’s outreach on the constitution will help increase access to information and opportunities for civil society/government engagement in the constitutional drafting assembly.

Background
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

LTI’s ongoing ramp up requires the ability to rapidly capture, visualize, analyze, and integrate the influx of new data that will stream into the program. The mapping and analysis STTA will provide technical assistance to ensure that LTI is fully utilizing this data to heighten its situational awareness, deepen its contextual analysis, and monitor and assess program outcomes. The STTA will work closely with the newly formed Information and Reporting team to assist with: (a) mapping and data visualizations; (b) baseline assessments and other survey projects; and © political, security, and strategic-level analysis. The STTA will help develop processes, products, and capacity so the Information and Reporting team can provide effective and timely analysis on evolving dynamics. 

The STTA will also provide technical assistance to LTI partners who are implementing projects that involve collecting, mapping, and analyzing research data. These partners will likely include those involved in crowdsourcing (Momken and Pci) or conducting surveys (government stakeholders or initiatives, such as the National Dialogue). The STTA will support the work of the Information and Reporting team and report directly to LTI’s Chief of Party (COP). 

This activity assumes that improved mapping and analysis will help LTI and its partners develop programming, calibrate strategy, and articulate impact.

This activity will support civic activism in the transition process by developing the talents of some of Libya's most promising documentary film-makers and improving access to information for the people of Libya. The activity will support the participation of five Libyan documentary film-makers in an immersive workshop with the Tribeca Film Institute and by giving them the opportunity to present their work at the Tribeca Film Festival over the course of seven days in New York. The participants are from across Libya, from Benghazi, Khoms, Sabha and Tripoli; and the themes of their films include the plight of undocumented immigrants in southern Libya, the lack of safe parks and open spaces in Benghazi for children and their families, and the rise of Libya's militias. By promoting and increasing the capacity of these Libyan film-makers, this activity will increase the pool of professional and credible activists and media professionals, and provide inspiration for other moderate voices who will take Libya's stories to the international stage.

There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts.

In order to counter the destabilizing trend of public disengagement, LTI is providing catalytic support to enable civil society to effectively participate in political processes as well as creating opportunities to impact their communities through “Thinking Nationally, Act Locally” initiatives. LTI is engaging politically marginalized and conflict vulnerable groups, and build their linkages with local and national government. To promote inclusive and informed participation in key political processes, LTI is supporting initiatives that raise awareness on critical issues, create opportunities for civil society to engage with government, and empower effective advocacy.

The Libya Institute for Advanced Studies (LIAS), based in Tripoli, Libya, is a leading private training institution dedicated to educating Libya’s next generation of leaders. Founded in 2012, LIAS is the first private education institution established after the Libyan Revolution. LIAS is committed to excellence in teaching, impactful learning that allows graduates to contribute to their communities and country, research aligned with solving critical socio-economic challenges and preserving heritage, and rehabilitative services for the survivors of the Revolution. LIAS has six specialized faculties in addition to a rehabilitation center for war survivors and an affiliated business incubator. It offers courses ranging from professional education to degree programs for professional and personal development.

For this activity, LIAS has partnered with the Tribeca Film Institute to offer an ""immersive film-makers workshop"" in documentary film production. The program includes 2 days of structured workshops, which focus on pitching and treatments, distribution strategies, creative problem solving, and other relevant areas. The workshops are facilitated by and elite group of leaders in the documentary film-making circle, and include both structured sessions, and ongoing mentorship during the full film festival. After the workshops, the film-makers will be invited to a program of private film screenings, networking events, the Tribeca Interactive Conference, and a private tour of Tribeca’s premiere digital interactive space, Storyscapes. Finally, the program will also include three group screenings of the Libyan film-makers' work to the Tribeca Film Festival itself.

The aim of this program will be to take these film-makers to a higher level, able to tell Libya's story to an international audience, and return to Libya empowered to continue their work which focuses on some of the key issues which Libya faces today. The participants are from across Libya, from Benghazi, Khoms, Sabha and Tripoli; and the themes of their films include illegal migration in southern Libya, the story of a hospital in Benghazi, and the rise of Libya's militias. By promoting and increasing the capacity of these Libyan film-makers, this activity will increase the pool of professional and credible activists, and provide inspiration for other moderate voices, who see the potential to take Libya's stories to the international stage.

This activity assumes that by taking Libyan film-makers to an elite workshop and film festival on documentary film-making, that these participants will have an increased capacity and desire to be positive role models and moderate voices which are beneficial to Libya's transition.

This activity seeks to support civic activism in transition processes by assisting the Lawyers for Justice in Libya to effectively advocate for the inclusion of human rights in transitional governance and justice through two broad initiatives. LFJL’s Sawti campaign promotes the legal protection of freedom of expression, press and information priorities through activities targeting both the civil society sector as well as the legal and governance communities. The Strategic Litigation and Legal Advocacy Initiative aims to empower lawyers, civil society and citizens across the whole of Libya, with human rights and advocacy tools. LTI’s backing of these two initiatives is an essential means to promote a peaceful democratic transition in Libya.

","Litigate, Advocate, Communicate! Supporting Human Rights Campaigns in Libya","
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with a Constitution Drafting Assembly. However, the participation of civil society groups, activists and community leaders is essential for maintaining this momentum.

In order to counter the destabilizing trend of public disengagement, LTI is providing catalytic support to enable civil society to effectively participate in political processes as well as creating opportunities to impact their communities through both national and locally-relevant initiatives. To promote inclusive and informed participation in key political processes, LTI is supporting initiatives that raise awareness on critical issues, create opportunities for civil society to engage with government, and empower effective advocacy. Within this vein, LTI will support Lawyers for Justice in Libya to implement two critical campaigns focused on freedom of expression and the inclusion of human rights in governance and transitional justice efforts. 

Lawyers for Justice in Libya is nongovernmental organization that was established in response to the February 2011 uprising by a network of Libyan lawyers with the critical focus of promoting human rights and rule of law in Libya. LFJL’s network is comprised of approximately 60 lawyers based in over 16 communities across Libya including Tripoli, Benghazi, Misrata, Bani Walid, and Sabha. LFJL’s activities have included capacity building workshops for Libyan lawyers, judges and legal professionals; trainings on investigating and documenting human rights violations; and a nationwide constitutional awareness and education project. 

LFJL’s Sawti campaign promotes the legal protection of freedom of expression, press and information priorities through activities targeting both the civil society sector as well as the legal and governance communities. At the core of Sawti are three key objectives, which each will help counter the destabilizing trend of public disengagement by strengthening the norm of freedom of expression in Libya. The three objectives are:

* To increase public awareness and understanding of the right to freedom of expression in Libya;
* To empower key stakeholders in Libya and equip them with the proper instruments to enforce and protect this right; and
* To promote legal protection and the development of a proper national legal framework aligned to international standards, to the aspirations of Libya’s Constitutional Declaration and those of the Libyan people.

In addition to aiding LFJL to implement the Sawti campaign, LTI will also provide essential support to the Strategic Litigation and Legal Advocacy Initiative. This initiative aims to empower lawyers, civil society and citizens across the whole of Libya, with human rights and advocacy tools so that Libya becomes a more just and equitable society based on the rule of law. The goal of the project is to ensure that the legal community and civil society in all localities in Libya are well-equipped to undertake human rights cases to deal with past abuses, abuses committed during the transition, and future cases of human rights violations. In building this capacity, the project will promote public engagement in political processes during the transition and support the mechanisms for Libyans to resolve grievances around human rights violations through a non-violent process under the rule of law.

This activity will establish a computer room with seventeen computers, a VSAT, and a year’s Internet subscription. The center is located in Dirj, approximately 100km from Ghadames, a diverse population hub that is home to the traditionally marginalized Tuareg community who moved from Ghadames after the revolution. The Dirj Scouts will manage the center and provide computer skills training to ensure that local civil society organizations have a safe, culturally-acceptable space to connect with people, communicate about issues, and participate in the political process.

Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

In the Nafusa Mountains, perceptions of exclusion from key political processes have led to boycotts and disruption of services by the Amazigh community. In addition, rivalries between towns with different ethnic or political alliances continue to hamper positive engagement and trust building between different communities. LTI will seek to build upon its work in Ghadames by commencing with initial Nafusa-wide grants which build trust and bring communities together with one another, and seek to engage them in nationwide activities which result in tangible benefits to the community and increase the collaboration both between these towns, and with the Libyan state apparatus. After conducting several grants in Ghadames, LTI is now moving to target other regions in the Nafusa mountains, seeking to build relations with key communities – particularly Amazigh groups – and the state.

In order to counter the destabilizing trend of public disengagement, LTI is providing catalytic support to enable civil society to effectively participate in political processes as well as creating opportunities to impact their communities through “Thinking Nationally, Act Locally” initiatives. LTI is engaging politically marginalized and conflict vulnerable groups, and build their linkages with local and national government. To promote inclusive and informed participation in key political processes, LTI is supporting initiatives that raise awareness on critical issues, create opportunities for civil society to engage with government, and empower effective advocacy.

Dirj is a town located in in the mid-west of Libya around 100km from Ghadames, with a population of 6,000. The social fabric in Dirj consists of groups originating from various different places in Libya. These include Tuareg and other groups from the local area, and those from further afield, including a significant population with origins in Zintan. During the revolution the Tuareg groups from Ghadames & Dirj fought alongside Qadhafi's forces, not just in the Nafusa area but also in Misurata. In the aftermath of the revolution, the power dynamics in the area have changed significantly, with many revenge attacks occurring in the town and surrounding region. In response to this, civil society organizations are working to bring groups together and build peace in this fractured town. However, they face significant challenges due in part to the lack of reliable communication and information sources in this isolated town.

In response to this situation, LTI is proposing to implement an information center in Dirj, to build trust between different groups, and fill the gap for training, information and communication in the town. The Dirj Scout and Girl Guide Movement was established in 1959 in Dirj. The Scout and Girl Guide Movement escaped the ban on almost any form of independent organization under the Qadhafi regime, when Muammar Gaddafi was ruler of Libya, because of its non-political stance and because Gaddafi was briefly a Scout while growing up in the southern town of Sabha. But in the Libyan civil war Scouts acted as front-line support troops for the anti-Gaddafi forces, and are seen as a positive force for unity across the country as a whole. 
 
The Scouts movement in Dirj city is well placed to manage an information center.  They are a respected civil society organization that has engaged in civic education and awareness campaigns in Dirj in many areas. This center will allow civil society actors, women, youth to connect with others locally and nationally to learn more about the activities and developments taking place in the political and cultural spheres.  

This activity is aimed at the implementation of a computer center of seventeen computers, with VSAT broadband. It aims to create a suitable space where youth, women and CSOs will be able to access and share information about the issues related to the political transition and general news about Libya and the world. The IT trainings to be conducted at the center will also enable women to become more proficient in the utilization of technology and learn more about how to participate in political processes such as the upcoming elections of the constitutional drafting committee.

LTI has hired an STTA (TRIP079) to coordinate and liaise with the centers across the country, and provide technical assistance and support as needed. The consultant has visited a number of centers around the country, and is developing plans for increased coordination and sustainability of both the network and individual centers.

The assumption behind this activity is that increased access to information and skills will contribute to Libyans playing a more active role in the transitional processes. By empowering the public to learn about the constitution, human rights, reconciliation, transitional justice and other related transition issues through IT and the center, this will facilitate discussions and dialogue around key political processes such as the constitutional drafting process and elections. The center will function as a medium for people of different tribes, genders and backgrounds to gather and learn about political topics. The center will also be accessible to the general population of Dirj.

The grant will provide the Early Intervention Center for Hearing Impaired Children with equipment that will enable the Center to more effectively educate their students and assist them to integrate into public schools when possible. People with disabilities in Libya are an under-served population, with little access to educational opportunities and a lack of resources provided by the central government, but assisting this school has been identified by the Local Council of Tajoura as a priority for their community, and the Council has already provided it with some support. The Local Council and citizens are actively lobbying national level government for resources for the Center, and LTI seeks to catalyze these efforts, by providing equipment and publicity, to highlight their needs, and build links between government and people.

Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement.

The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

Situated east of Mitiga Airport and bordering the Arrada neighborhood of Suq al Juma, Tajoura is a city in the Tripoli District of Libya, though often considered an expansion of greater Tripoli city. It is home to approximately 230,000 people, and includes urban areas closer to the center of Tripoli, as well as semi-urban areas of housing and farmland which stretches east and encompasses the major road to Misrata and the East of Libya. Tajoura was known, even prior to the revolution, as being a site of major opposition to Qadhafi, and during the war the city suffered many casualties. Tajoura was one of the first areas of Tripoli to lead protests against Qadhafi on 17 February 2011 and the first part of Tripoli to be “liberated” from Qadhafi force on August 20th that year. Tajoura is considered a priority area for LTI programs due to its prominent role as a “buffer” to Tripoli from militias or other groups seeking to influence developments in the capital, and its status as a focal point positive development projects which can shape the future of Tripoli. 

In response to these trends, LTI is implementing clusters of visible, tangible community improvement projects that help foster interaction between communities and their government, boost government legitimacy, bolster community security, and spark local-level change. By bringing together local authorities, civil society, and community members to deliver practical projects like community parks and football fields, these activities aim to build relationships among key stakeholders and improve confidence in the transition and in the government. The projects also seek to empower moderate voices to ‘Think Nationally, Act Locally,” strengthen local resiliencies that reject extremism, and promote conflict-sensitive local development. To maximize impact, LTI will work with local partners to ensure that there is a media plan in place to publicize and promote the projects. 

According to UNICEF, around 60,000 people in Libya have hearing issues. During the war, deaf and mute young men formed the “Misrata Deaf Brigade” to fight against Qadhafi forces, which made international news. Under the Qadhafi regime, the hearing impaired had few education and employment opportunities, and were kept ostracized from society. The center is a point of pride for Tajoura and the local government in Tajoura, as it symbolizes a marked change from the Qadhafi-era when the deaf were partially neglected by the state and CSOs were banned. 

The Ministry of Education has just established an office to integrate people with disabilities into governmental schooling systems. In the long term, the office will attempt to activate Law no.5 which was created in 1987 under the Qadhafi regime and compels the state to ensure all necessary assistance is given to people with disabilities. The MoE has made very limited progress so far, equipping only 99 students around Libya (33 east, 33 west, 33 south) with appropriate hearing aid systems designed specifically for hearing impaired students. However the MoE highlights that this is a pilot phase, and to support all schools in Libya will take time, and a large amount of government funding.

In response to the lack of action by the government, some citizens of Tajoura decided to take the initiative and act locally and support their local government and people. As a result, they established the Schools for the Hearing Impaired in the center of Tajoura; gaining support from the Local Council, the center managed to provide education and limited equipment for 53 students. By working with the School for the Hearing Impaired in Tajoura, LTI will help to support what this community believes to be one of its flagship initiatives. Identified by the Local Council as an immediate priority for follow up, this project will highlight the attempts by local authorities to gain access to funds, even while state funding structures are heavily delayed or impossible to access.

This community improvement project will have two components. It will provide the center with desks, laptops, software, uniforms and other items to improve the facilities of the center and better enable the teachers to effectively instruct the hearing impaired students. The project will also include a high visibility event that LTI will help the center to organize, inviting a significant number of community members and government officials. This activity will engage with the Early Intervention Center for Hearing Impaired Children in Tajoura. The grant aims to expand upon the assistance the previous local council government had provided to the Center, and to increase awareness of the impressive work being done by the Center in the community. The Early Intervention Center for Hearing Impaired is a prime example of the potential to increase civil society/government engagement, as it is an example of cooperation between local authorities and people, and also because both the Local Council and citizens are actively lobbying national level government for resources. LTI seeks to catalyze these efforts, by providing equipment and publicity to the center, to highlight their needs, and build links between government and people.

LTI will support the organization of the event which will be closely coordinated with the Tajoura Local government. The Ministry of Education and Ministry of Social Affairs will be invited along with civil society organizations, other handicapped assistance groups, and community members to an event at the school which will highlight not only the Local government’s previous support, but their assistance in connecting the Center with USAID. 

This activity assumes that supporting civil society organizations in collaboration with local government will boost government legitimacy and build linkages between the government and the community.

This activity aims to support civic activism in transition processes by assisting the Tajoura Cultural Center, which has been identified as a priority by the previous Tajoura Local Council. The grant will provide the Tajoura Cultural Center with equipment and Internet access that will enable the Center to attract more visitors, particularly youth and women, to the Center to use their computer center and take advantage of offered cultural events. Investment in cultural spaces was minimal under the Qadhafi regime and this trend has unfortunately continued in the transition period, but supporting this center has been identified by the previous Local Council of Tajoura as a priority for their community. As one of the most active Cultural Centers in Tripoli, the Tajoura Cultural Center is a strong partner for LTI to support in partnership with the previous Local Council of Tajoura who has handed over all the project they have started to the new elected Municipal Council.

To maximize impact, LTI will work with local partners to ensure that there is a media plan in place to publicize and promote the projects. 

The previous Local Council of Tajoura was relatively popular among residents, who considered it a legitimate body as it was elected by constituents and was fairly visible in the community. The Council was very receptive to working on community improvement projects with LTI, and identified the Tajoura Cultural Center as a priority location for LTI’s support. While cultural activities were marginalized under Qadhafi, the Center’s leadership is dedicated to introducing cultural events to Tajoura residents, particularly the younger generation. The Tajoura Cultural Center has shown a commitment to community engagement through its previous activities. In 2013 the Center held over 23 cultural workshops, lectures, and other programs. Recently the Ministry of Culture provided the Cultural Center with 14 computers, new desks, tables, and chairs, in recognition of their efforts and good work for the community. The Ministry provided computers to the Suq al Juma Cultural Center as well, and the two Centers were the only locations out of seven Cultural Centers in Tripoli to receive this assistance. The Ministry said they could not afford to provide an Internet connection however, as they felt they would have to provide it to all of the Centers.

On the 26th of April Tajoura Municipality had their first Municipal Elections, which resulted in electing seven new members to replace the management team at the Local Council of Tajoura. The new Local Government is now officially called ""Tajoura Municipal Council’’ , and the new members will now have to elect a mayor to represent Tajoura. During this time, the Local Council will continue their tasks normally, and an official handover will take place once the new mayor is in place. In response to this, LTI has discussed with the Local Council the necessity of ensuring continued cooperation between LTI and the Municipal Council. The Local Council - through the Deputy Head of the Council - has guaranteed their commitment to all LTI projects, and have agreed to facilitate any required meeting, actions and proper handover on all projects under development in Tajoura. In addition, the Local Council have agreed to facilitate any contact with other Government bodies that are prioritized by LTI.   

This community improvement project will provide internet access, improved facilities for lectures and workshops, and expand the children’s section of the Center to allow parents to participate in the Center’s events. Currently, the full cost of the Center’s activities and the internet connection for administrative staff come from the private funds of the Center’s leadership, and the schedule for 2014 is currently much lighter than last year due to this continued financial burden. While few people currently visit the Center outside of the special events, with free internet access for visitors, the Center anticipates a marked increase in visitors, particularly youth and students as well as families and women. The project will be coordinated with the Tajoura Local/Municipal Council, and the Ministry of Culture, who will be invited to participate in a community celebration after the installation of new equipment and internet.

Women are the main beneficiaries of this activity, as they are the most active participants in the Cultural Center activities. Youth are also a targeted beneficiary, as the Center offers an ideal study spot and can be used to host events that are attractive to younger audiences. There are increasing concerns that extremist influences are gaining a foothold among youth in Tajoura, and there are few outlets for recreational, cultural, or community activities. Engaging both women and youth is critical to promote moderate voices, provide positive role models, and encourage positive participation in the political transition.

This activity assumes that supporting local government organizations in partnership with civil society will boost government legitimacy and encourages civic activism.

Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

As the political and economic capital of Libya, the stability and security of Tripoli are of paramount importance to the Libyan transition. Events in Tripoli have knock on effects around the country, and as a result, the city has become a central focus area in which power games between different factions are played out. Citizens of Tripoli have shown their willingness to stand up against militias and push for a country with legitimate political and security institutions, however their efforts must be supported by local civil society and governance initiatives if they are to succeed on a long term basis. Tripoli wide programming seeks to engage and involve key groups in Tripoli to contribute to the positive development of the city. By engaging moderate voices, local government, and civic organizations citywide, LTI will build trust between the state and citizens, and strengthen the hand of positive players in Libya’s development at both the local and national levels.

In order to counter the destabilizing trend of public disengagement, LTI is providing catalytic support to enable civil society to effectively participate in political processes as well as creating opportunities to impact their communities through “Thinking Nationally, Act Locally” initiatives. LTI is engaging politically marginalized and conflict vulnerable groups, and build their linkages with local and national government. To promote inclusive and informed participation in key political processes, LTI is supporting initiatives that raise awareness on critical issues, create opportunities for civil society to engage with government, and empower effective advocacy.

LHAM is a Libyan NGO with significant experience in responding to conflict in Libya, and a good network of partners within both government and civil society. LHAM previously worked with LTI under BENG021 and BENG022, and has a range of activities which include mediation, humanitarian support, and conflict resolution. LHAM's mediation and dialogue work is linked to the MOD and Army through the Human Rights and Civil Society Office of the MoD, and through the Army Spokesperson for Civil Affairs, who provide both logistical and political backing for access to key areas. LHAM also liaise with the “Presenter for Dialogue” of the Army, and with the GNC committees for Human Rights and Civil Society.

As a result of a recent assessment conducted by LHAM which identified youth as a key target actor for conflict mitigation, the organization is targeting youth in Tripoli, to begin to make connections between youth and those operating at the “higher” political levels. Through regular dialogue sessions (minimum of one per month) and three larger events, LHAM intend to raise awareness and engagement among different youth groups on key political and security issues in Libya. When possible and appropriate, LHAM will invite Government of Libya officials to participate in the events to meet with the youth.  This would enable these groups to play a more effective role in the society and, will help prepare the youth of today to be the leaders of tomorrow. This grant builds upon a model established under SABH001, whereby LTI provides office space and equipment to allow the grantee to become a social hub for activities, all of which are directly related to the LTI grant during the duration of the activity. LHAM’s office is in downtown Tripoli, very close to Martyrs square. It has two large meeting/training rooms which will be used for dialogues and other training sessions to be held on a regular basis.

This civic activism and political process project will support LHAM workshops for youth in Tripoli. A rented administrative hub and office furniture will be provided and the grantee will organize youth outreach events. In addition, provisions such as location rental, written materials and catering will be provided for three larger events which will engage youth on key issues such as violence media and political activists, responsible citizenship/national unity, and building links between youth and political actors. This grant will also support the provision of stipends for two clerks at the LHAM office, to ensure it remains open and active as a hub for youth groups in the city.

This activity assumes that by engaging youth in political and transitional processes, that it will help to build an active citizenry which have an interest in contributing to Libya’s development in a positive manner.

",Snapshot of Local Public Perceptions in Key Areas of Libya,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

In response to these trends, LTI is beginning to implement clusters of visible, tangible community improvement projects that will help to boost government legitimacy, bolster confidence in the transition, and spark local-level change. By bringing together local government authorities, civil society, and community members to plan, implement and deliver practical projects like community parks and football fields, these activities aim to promote positive interactions between community and government, as well contribute to improve perceptions of government responsiveness. The projects also seek to empower moderate voices to ‘Think Nationally, Act Locally,” strengthen local resiliencies that reject extremism, and productively engage at-risk youth. To maximize impact, LTI will work with local partners to ensure that there is a media plan in place to promote the projects, publicize events, and incorporate Government Libya branding whenever possible. 

This activity is to conduct focus group discussions in order to provide a snapshot of popular perceptions on government institutions, local governance, and service delivery in six areas where the Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) is implementing clusters of visible, tangible community improvement projects that seek to boost government legitimacy, bolster confidence in the transition, and spark local-level change. In order to be strategically focused, LTI will cluster the initial round of community improvement projects in six primary areas: Tajoura (a district in Tripoli), Sabha (Southwest), Awbari (Southwest), Derna (East), Shahat (East), and Benghazi (particularly the areas around Sabri District). While some projects will also be implemented in other areas as opportunities arise, these clusters were selected to receive the greatest concentration of community improvement projects based on several criteria: (a) local level dynamics that impact the national level; (b) the presence of willing and capable local partners; (c) feasibility; and (d) ensuring regional balance.

The data from the focus group discussions will help guide programming and improve reporting on these community improvement project clusters by providing a snapshot of local perceptions on government institutions, local governance, and service delivery. Diwan, a Libyan research company, will conduct two focus groups in each of the six clusters, for a total of twelve focus groups. Separate focus groups will be held for men and women. Participants for the focus groups will range from ages 18 to approximately 35 or 40. This age range was selected based on the assumption that these younger demographics will be the primary change agents and influencers of stability in Libya’s transition. 

LTI will develop focus group questions that reflect that community improvement objectives, and LTI will coordinate closely with Diwan on the translation of the questions as well as training Diwan researchers to ensure they understand the purpose of the questions and the project’s methodology. Diwan will conduct a pre-test exercise to provide initial feedback on the clarity and quality of the questions, and to provide an opportunity to improve the data by fine-tuning the questionnaire. Diwan will provide LTI with the completed questionnaires, data files, and completed contact sheets. LTI will be responsible for analyzing the data. 

The activity assumes that this snapshot data on local perceptions will help LTI recalibrate strategy, tailor programming, target key groups more effectively, and inform reporting products.

",Senior Engineer Advisor for Community Improvements Activities,"
Libya’s revolution overthrew 42 years of repressive rule by the Qadhafi regime, initiating a political transition that seeks to create a stable, democratic state rooted in strong national unity. Libya held elections for its General National Congress (GNC) on July 7, 2012, successfully completing the first major milestone along the transition roadmap. However, the development of a constitution is behind schedule, the new state has struggled to deliver services and security, and frustration is mounting among a population that has little experience with political engagement and a lingering legacy of distrust towards government.  

Throughout Tripoli, Benghazi and Sabha, Libyans continue to suffer from the legacy of decades of under investment and service delivery, creating a shared doubt in the political transition processes. Citizens of Tripoli have shown their willingness to stand up against militias and push for a country with legitimate security institutions, however their efforts must be supported by local civil society and governance initiatives if they are to succeed on a long term basis. Meanwhile, as the birthplace of Libya’s revolution, Benghazi has become a symbol of the transition’s challenges. During the first quarter of 2014, nearly half of all recorded incidents of violence occurred in Benghazi. The government has stepped up security deployments, but Salafi groups like Ansar al-Sharia continue to clash with Special Forces and create instability. As the hub of southwestern Libya, Sabha connects the surrounding cities such as Ubari, Murzuq and Brak as a vital focal point, politically and economically. The city has seen several deadly clashes during the first quarter of 2014, yet, many of the obstacles are the result of underdevelopment and a lack of focus on the south from the central government. 

In response to these trends, LTI is implementing clusters of visible, tangible community improvement projects that help to boost government legitimacy, bolster community security, and spark local-level change. By bringing together local authorities, civil society, and the private sector to deliver practical projects like the rehabilitation or establishment of community centers, parks and sports fields. These activities aim to build relationships among key stakeholders and improve confidence in the transition. The projects seek to empower moderate voices to ‘Think Nationally, Act Locally,” strengthen local resiliencies that reject extremism, and promote conflict-sensitive local development. To maximize impact, LTI will work with local government authorities and civil society partners to ensure that there are outreach and media plans in place to publicize and promote the projects. 

This STTA will contribute to these projects by offering oversight to design, implementation plan development, vendor evaluation and project monitoring for a number of high-profile community improvement grants. This Advisor will oversee and direct all engineering components of LTI’s grant activities to ensure the soundness of design and construction while ensuring that all activities adhere to the environment requirements of USAID, and will actively coordinate with program managers and teams to ensure timely roll out and completion of community improvement activities.

The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

As the political and economic capital of Libya, the stability and security of Tripoli are of paramount importance to the Libyan transition. Events in Tripoli have knock on effects around the country, and as a result, the city has become a central focus area in which power games between different factions are played out. Citizens of Tripoli have shown their willingness to stand up against militias and push for a country with legitimate political and security institutions, however their efforts must be supported by local civil society and governance initiatives if they are to succeed on a long term basis. Tripoli wide programming seeks to engage and involve key groups in Tripoli to contribute to the positive development of the city. By engaging moderate voices, local government, and civic organizations citywide, LTI will build trust between the state and citizens, and strengthen the hand of positive players in Libya’s development at both the local and national levels.

In order to counter the destabilizing trend of public disengagement, LTI is providing catalytic support to enable civil society to effectively participate in political processes as well as creating opportunities to impact their communities through “Thinking Nationally, Act Locally” initiatives. LTI is engaging politically marginalized and conflict vulnerable groups, and build their linkages with local and national government. To promote inclusive and informed participation in key political processes, LTI is supporting initiatives that raise awareness on critical issues, create opportunities for civil society to engage with government, and empower effective advocacy.

Mona Abdullah is one of the civil society key activists who participated in the BRDI advocacy skills training TRIP063. She worked with many CSO’s and attended workshops, and conferences of different topics and has the experience in dealing with abused women issues. Mona is gathering a team of five highly qualified members who are having good connections with media figures, lawyers, and human rights activists. Their first advocacy activity will focus on Libyan women married to non-Libyans. They believe this issue is an important one because it results in the depriving of rights from many children – voting, owning property, free education, free healthcare and many other rights any Libyan citizen enjoys.  

This civic activism project will support nine days’ workshop in three different areas in Libya for Libyan women married to non-Libyans in Libya. According to the grantee, this issue affects 10% of the married female population of Libya, and has repeatedly been raised by activists, however no action has been taken to remedy the situation. LTI will provide technical support for the workshop materials and one day conference. The grantee will contact figures of different backgrounds and provide workshop venue. As a result, the workshop will reach key actors of many levels who will be, by the end of the workshop, able to spread the word and stress the issue when forming the constitution. 

This activity assumes that the workshop will make media and 60 committee generate a better understanding about the problems that encounter Libyan women married to non-Libyans and their children and will probably pave the way for articles supporting their position in the new constitution.

",Let’s Talk about What’s Going On: National Dialogue Support Fund,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

In January 2014, the National Dialogue Preparatory Commission (NPDC) announced the launch of a new initiative to promote reconciliation, reinforce national unity, and reinvigorate the transition through comprehensive discussions on important social, political, and security issues. Although it is in its early stages, the national dialogue process has emerged as significant transition priority. LTI is providing technical assistance with civil society engagement, strategic communications, and other areas as requested.

Over the next several months, the NDPC will focus on two main priorities: (1) outreach and education to inform people across the country about the process, and (2) consultations to build consensus around a framework of principles that will shape and guide the process going forward. In March, the NDPC conducted an outreach and engagement tour in 22 cities across Libya. 8 cities remain on the initial itinerary, and the NDPC is contemplated a second phase that would cover an additional 20 cities. The NDPC plans to hold a national conference that will enshrine these principles in a National Dialogue charter, consolidate support around the process, and set the next stage for conducting national dialogues on substantive issues that are yet to be agreed upon (e.g. security, national identity, etc.).

This DDGS will create a flexible fund to rapidly respond to urgent requests to support the National Dialogue with information dissemination, outreach events, meetings, or other activities that aim to engage civil society in this critical transition process. In recent weeks, LTI has received several requests from the NDPC to provide support, including hosting several workshops. Additionally, LTI’s civil society engagement STTA (TRIP087) is planning to conduct field visits and initiate activities that leverage LTI’s existing partner network in support of the National Dialogue, and this DDGS could provide funding for those efforts. 

This activity assumes that there will be sufficient political will and public interest to sustain the National Dialogue initiative.

To maximize impact, LTI will work with local partners to ensure that there is a media plan in place to publicize and promote the projects.

Youth played a pivotal role in the revolution and define a majority of the population in Libya. The median age of the country is approximately 25 years of age. Youth have become growingly frustrated with the new leadership for ignoring their input; dismissing their passion and taking for granted their support. In Tripoli, as elsewhere, Libyan youth have demonstrated a sophisticated level of interest in how the transition occurs and what the end results will be. Considering that youth constitute a formidable percentage of the population, their feelings of marginilization and distance from the direction the revolution has gone could have a significant negative impact on the country going forward.

Experience has shown that Libyan youth have their own ways to engage in the transition in a positive manner. LTI has supported many youth led organizations in past, and has received submissions on many creative projects, including graffiti, skateboarding, filmmaking, photo competitions, etc. Of all these, football remains a cornerstone of young Libyan men's activities, and has been used by LTI as a method of community engagement in grants such as TRIP103: Kicking for Peace! Football and Dialogue in Ghadames, and BENG026: Goooooal! Supporting Moderate Voices in Derna thru Open Spaces. 

There is huge excitement in Libya around the World Cup, and it is one of the few positive news stories in an increasingly uncertain political climate. Many coffee shops and public places have published match lists, and are promoting the event as something to bring people together around football. In addition, The Libyan national team recently won the African Championship in a middle of many political disappointments, and all Libyan cities participated in the celebrations. Libya’s team was held up as a symbol of unity as it was drawn from across Libya, hailing from Tripoli, Benghazi, Misrata, Zawiya and other towns, and their victory was celebrated with a nationwide public holiday.

LTI will build on this public support by hosting large scale events in a public space in Tripoli - likely Al Attihad Football Club - to provide youth in the city with an opportunity to meet other youth and feel a part of the new Libya. The screenings, which will be of all World Cup games from the quarter finals onwards, will be highly publicized as an example of the type of sporting and cultural events which can take place if Libyans continue to push for unity and peace in the development of their country. 

The Mirror Libya Group believes that sport is a way to unite society; it influences their views, values, hopes, loyalties and fears. The Mirror Libya Group is a leading Media Services and event management firm established post-revolution in Tripoli, they are committed to reflecting an honest and transparent image of Libya through providing different media services and activities that serve the Libyan communities and contributes to the country positively with their professional staff and volunteers.

This activity will provide the Mirror Libya Group with equipment and support to enable live viewing of World Cup matches from the quarter finals onwards on a grand scale. LTI will support with rental and purchase of equipment including a large outdoor screen system, sound system, cameras, generator, and other supplies to cover the matches.  In addition, The Mirror Libya Group will host a large outreach campaign to bring youth to the event as well as promote positive messages about the importance of youth working together to stay engaged in Libya's transition. Outreach would be conducted through radio, billboards, leaflets and online campaigns. Other sponsors are also funding prizes for quizes and games that will take place during the match viewings.  Through these, the Mirror Libya Group aims to reach out to youth who are feeling distanced from post-revolutionary Libya and help them work together to beomce active members of society.

This activity assumes that supporting the coverage of the World Cup in Tripoli will help create a positive environment that engage marginalized youth and ecourage them to work together for the positive development of Libya.

",The Road to a Comprehensive National Dialogue: Strategic Communications Support,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, initiating local government elections, launching a National Dialogue process, and moving forward with elections for a Constitution Drafting Assembly. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

In January 2014, the National Dialogue Preparatory Commission (NPDC) announced the launch of a new initiative to promote reconciliation, reinforce national unity, and reinvigorate the transition process through comprehensive discussions on important social, political, and security issues. The next year will be critical to the success of the National Dialogue Preparatory Commission, and by extension Libya. 

Parliamentary elections that were just held on the 25th June will have an unpredictable effect on the political and security situation in Libya. Questions remain about whether the relatively light turnout is enough to legitimize a replacement to the GNC and ensure that the transitional phase continues without a further breakdown in security. There is a high level of probability that certain segments of society will emerge from the elections feeling marginalized and disenfranchised, making the task of consensus building and national unification a high priority for the government and the international community. It is this process of consensus building that the NDPC was set up to facilitate. 

Over the last several weeks, the NDPC came close to brokering a political agreement between different parties, groups and factions to underpin the elections with an agreed set of principles and a roadmap of priorities for the next legislature. Unfortunately, due to factors outside of the NDPC’s control, this process was mishandled and further progress was delayed until after the elections. Nonetheless political dialogue remains a priority for both the NDPC and the international community, and in the short term it is likely that much of the first few weeks of this activity would be spent trying to facilitate a political dialogue. To this end, the NDPC will soon announce a moment of unity with the Office of National Dialogue Consulting led by Mohammed Harrari, which will go a long way towards consolidating the authority of the NDPC to be exclusive conveners of National Dialogue. 

The longer-term goal of holding a full Comprehensive National Dialogue, involving 300 delegates, convened to draft, sign and uphold a National Charter remains unchanged and is expected to be held sometime in September/October. The first phase of the Comprehensive National Dialogue will last approximately two weeks while the National Charter is drafted and signed by the delegates. Subsequently, there will be a further phase, lasting between several weeks and several months, during which time broader issues including security, women’s rights, development, and natural resource sharing will be tackled. The majority of this contract period will therefore be taken up with building capacity, legitimacy, and public support for the Comprehensive National Dialogue. 

Within the fragmented political environment that currently exists in Libya, the National Dialogue Preparatory Commission represents a unique focal point for building consensus and national unity. It is inclusive, non-politically aligned, and diverse enough in the ethnic, tribal and ideological makeup of the Advisory Team to be able to reach all segments of Libyan society. Between the Political Dialogue and the Comprehensive National Dialogue, the work of the NDPC over the forthcoming three months will be critical to Libya’s transition.  

Fadeel Lameen has requested continued strategic communications support from the Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) during the early phases of the processes as he attempts to raise awareness and build buy-in for the initiative. The first phases of this support (under TRIP094 and TRIP101) helped to support this initiative and the national launch of the process. The core objective of the National Dialogue strategic communications campaign will continue to be to build consensus and unity across diverse segments of Libyan society while strengthening civil society institutions and enhancing the legitimacy of the central government in Tripoli. 

As a result of positive feedback from the NDPC under the previous grants, this activity will provide a team of senior communications professionals from Bell Pottinger who will offer strategic direction, communications campaign planning, and public relations support to the National Dialogue Preparatory Commission for a period of three months. Bell Pottinger’s senior team will continue strategic planning of the National Dialogue communications campaign by reviewing existing opinion research, clarifying communications objectives, and devising a strategy and subsequent set of appropriate communications tactics to target segmented audiences with a special emphasis on non-traditional means to reach hard to access demographics including rural populations and youth. Bell Pottinger will help NDPC develop a core set of narrative, monitor media coverage, develop more effective and efficient communications processes, design a National Dialogue Communications Strategy, and implement a strategic communications campaign in the outreach and consultation period prior to the National Conference. 

Bell Pottinger is a communications firm with extensive experience providing high-level technical assistance with strategic communications campaigns to governments in complex political transition environments.  

This activity assumes that a comprehensive, inclusive, and effective national dialogue process will contribute to a successful and stable political transition in Libya.

The activity will support six six-day workshops in Djerba, Tunisia, that will provide advanced training in conflict analysis, facilitated dialogues, and leadership skills to a select group of 150 thuwar that have registered with the Libya Program for Reintegration and Development (LPRD; formerly known as the Warrior Affairs Commission).  The advanced training will include participants from all regions of the country. LPRD seeks to transform thuwar into local leaders for stability, and participants in similar previous trainings (BENG045) have taken an active role in supporting Libya’s National Dialogue and started civil society organizations to positively impact local communities.

",Round Two: Advanced Training for Progress and Stability,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, holding successful local government elections, and continuing the development of an inclusive National Dialogue process. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

The Warriors Affairs Commission (WAC) was established on the 29th October 2011 by a resolution of the President of the Executive Office, Certification by the National Transitional Council and the Transitional Government. WAC was mandated to register, rehabilitate and reintegrate “those who fought in the front lines, defended cities and political prisoners” into formal state institutions, private-sector enterprises or education, thus giving them opportunities to contribute to the renaissance and development of Libya, for which they fought. WAC has produced impressive results including the establishment of a professional and data-base of 165,000 former Thuwar, all vetted through interviews and against brigade listings. Three years after WAC was established, it transformed into the “Libyan Programme for Reintegration and Development” (LPRD), under Cabinet Decision No. (888) 2013. 

The LPRD is a key institution for promoting stability in Libya. The Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) has developed a strong partnership with LPRD through: BENG014 (initial conflict transformation training); BENG045 (advanced training for 50 thuwar); BENG040 (institutional self-assessment); and TRIP092 (institutional reform).

The proposed courses are an expansion of the advanced training provided in BENG045. The advanced training feeds into LPRDs ‘Leadership’ program, one of the most essential projects targeting the leaders of the revolution. A core goal of the ‘Leadership’ program is to bring former Thuwar leaders and commanders on board in the dialogue and reconciliation process.  The courses will build the skills of these former military leaders to become leaders in facilitating dialogue. Because the participants will be former brigade leaders and other thuwar who are well respected within their communities, the program assumes that changing their mindset and encouraging them to positively contribute to peace efforts will likely have broad impact. Also, by mixing thuwar leaders from all regions, tribes, and social groups, the training will build relationships between them, as was shown in the previous courses.

Example of the practical impact of the previous advanced training support include: 
•	The pool of 50 graduates created two NGOs to continue their dialogue work. These organizations are unique because they are composed of Thuwar leaders from across tribal and regional lines;
•	10 graduates were selected to join the expert group of the National Dialogue Preparatory Commission (NDPC);
•	Some were invited to join the local Government in Benghazi to support local dialogue processes;
•	One NGO was created by two graduates that are aiming to bring back former Loyalist families from Tunisia and are facilitating dialogue between them and the local communities concerning their potential return.

Based on the success of the previous workshops, LPRD has requested six more advanced training courses. There is great need for facilitators of dialogue and leaders in conflict transformation in Libya, and the former thuwar leaders are extremely well placed to play an important role in Libya’s transition. Based on criteria developed in partnership with Transition International, LPRD staff will interview and screen potential participants before selecting them. Additionally, two of the six courses will be with former Ta-erath (women revolutionaries). These trainings will be held in Djerba, Tunisia. 

LPRD has established a partnership with the Moroccan High Human Rights Council which is that national expert house that planned and implemented the Moroccan reconciliation and transitional justice process. In collaboration with this Council, an advanced course in Morocco has been developed with the objective to give the advanced trainees under this grant and BENG045 a chance to experience how reconciliation processes worked in other countries in the Arab world. It is expected that the Council will provide further advanced training in dialogue and reconciliation for 200 thuwar. The 50 participants from BENG045 will go to Morocco, and the 150 participants from this activity will fill the remaining slots. 

Furthermore, LPRD needs assistance with documenting success stories on how their program is helping former thuwar become constructive citizens. As a result, this activity will support a communications specialist to compile ten success stories from participants who have put their training into practice to promote peace and stability. This will also ensure that these stories become rapidly available to USAID for advocacy purposes. 

This activity assumes that providing selected and vetted thuwar leaders with conflict resolution skills will help mitigate conflict and promote stability.

This activity will support civic activism in transition processes by increase Libyan capacity to conduct transparent and credible Council of Representatives (CoR) elections. Through essential support to the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), this grant will provide technical assistance to the High National Election Commission (HNEC) on electoral dispute resolution and strategic communications through the deployment of two technical advisors in the pre- and post-CoR electoral period. These technical assistance efforts are particularly crucial after polling day, for critical moments of the electoral process including the announcement of results; the submission of complaints; adjudication; and appeals. This
assistance will ensure the credibility of the upcoming electoral event, strengthen public confidence in the process, and reduce the risk of violence breaking out as a result of electoral disputes.

",Enhancing the Integrity of CoR Elections: Technical Assistance to HNEC,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. Recently, the
General National Congress (GNC) created the ""February Committee"" to propose a new roadmap to draft and pass a new constitution, and elect a new legislative body, the Council of Representatives (CoR), to replace the GNC. Political frustration with the GNC culminated when a militia group, calling itself the Libyan National
 
Army and led by General Khalifa Hiftar, launched airstrikes on extremist Islamist-leaning militias and stormed the GNC on May 18th to announce its suspension. Shortly thereafter, the High National Election Commission (HNEC), the election management body in charge of administering the electoral process, announced that elections for the CoR will take place on June 25, 2014.

In order to counter the destabilizing trend of public disengagement and the divisive possibility of significant electoral disputes, LTI is supporting efforts that productively engage politically marginalized and conflict vulnerable groups with local and national government. To promote inclusive and informed participation in key political processes, LTI is supporting initiatives that raise awareness on critical issues, create
opportunities for civil society to engage with government, and empower effective advocacy. There is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts.

Under USAID’s Libyan Elections and Governance Support (LEGS), as well through funding from donors including the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) in Canada and the UK Foreign Commonwealth Office (FCO), the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) has worked closely with the HNEC’s Board of Commissioners (BoC), secretariat, and staff to strengthen the HNEC’s institutional capacity to administer elections in Libya. In 2012, IFES supported HNEC by providing substantive input on
all operational phases of the GNC elections. IFES also drafted the first regulatory framework for election dispute resolution and campaign finance in post-revolution Libya, which was adopted by HNEC. In July
2012, IFES worked with HNEC to set up an Elections Media Center to enhance HNEC’s outreach to the public and media. In 2013 and 2014, IFES trained HNEC staff on drafting electoral procedures, and drafting EDR and campaign finance regulations. IFES has supported HNEC and Libyan Judiciary in setting up an EDR mechanism for the CA elections, hiring of legal advisors for 17 electoral committees, and training those advisors on the campaign finance monitoring process.

LTI will support IFES to continue its technical assistance to HNEC through two separate, but complementary, efforts designed to increase Libyan capacity to conduct transparent and credible CoR elections. IFES will deploy an Election Dispute Resolution (EDR) advisor to advise HNEC in formulating a strategic approach to its involvement in the adjudication of electoral disputes. The EDR expert will work with HNEC, BoC and legal staff to review the existing regulatory framework to improve Libya’s EDR mechanism for the CoR elections. IFES will also seek to enhance communication between the HNEC and judiciary to implement a transparent and easily comprehensible EDR process that will increase the legitimacy of elections. In particular, the EDR Advisor will support the HNEC and judiciary on EDR-related matters during the crucial phases of voter registration, polling, and results announcement. As these elections have the possibility to be more divisive than others in Libyan history, ensuring proper management of electoral disputes following the elections is critical.

In addition, IFES will deploy a Media and Communications Advisor to assist the HNEC with the creation of a communications strategy to enhance the integrity of the electoral process through increased access and communication with the public as well as national and international media. The CoR elections and electoral aftermath are an important time for HNEC to communicate with the public with messaging that strengthens public confidence in the electoral process.

These technical assistance efforts are particularly crucial in the post-election period. While EDR mechanisms take place throughout the electoral cycle, they will be especially predominant after polling day for critical events including the announcement of results; submission of complaints; adjudication; and appeals. Strategic communications will play a crucial role during this electoral event in anticipation of increased publicity surrounding the contentious political environment. This assistance will ensure the credibility of the upcoming electoral event, strengthen public confidence in the process, and reduce the risk of violence breaking out as a result of electoral disputes.

This support seeks to enhance the capacity of moderate voices to engage at-risk groups in community projects and build local institutions that engage positively with youth and to improve the people’s confidence in the capacity of local government. This activity aims to supply 12 sets of playground equipment and 12 sets of safety surfacing for the playground equipment in support of the Libya Transition Initiative (LTI) program. The park spaces are throughout the country and in areas prone to current/future extremist threats, high incidence of crime, and/or areas in which spaces for mixing and dialogue are limited. Activities will be built around these parks, of which the playground equipment is a component, and will create a space for men, women and youth from different tribes and groups to participate in positive, constructive activities. By engaging local government institutions and officials in the public events, these activities will boost opportunities for engagement between government and its citizens at a key time in Libya’s transition.

",Strengthening Resiliencies & Opening Up Public Spaces throughout Libya,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a crossroads. Slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. The post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility complicates the transition roadmap, erodes support for the government, and exacerbates grievances that extremists and other opportunistic spoilers can utilize as recruitment tools. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward but there is a critical need to capitalize on this momentum by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts. 

Throughout Tripoli, Benghazi and Sabha, Libyans continue to suffer from the legacy of decades of under investment and service delivery, creating a shared doubt in the political transition processes. Citizens of Tripoli have shown their willingness to stand up against militias and push for a country with legitimate security institutions, however their efforts must be supported by local civil society and governance initiatives if they are to succeed on a long term basis. Meanwhile, as the birthplace of Libya’s revolution, Benghazi has become a symbol of the transition’s challenges. During the first quarter of 2014, nearly half of all recorded incidents of violence occurred in Benghazi. Open conflict between moderate forces under Hefter and Salafi groups like Ansar al-Sharia and the 17th of February brigade in the ongoing Operation Dignity military campaign continue to create instability. As the hub of southwestern Libya, Sabha connects the surrounding cities such as Ubari, Murzuq and Brak as a vital focal point, politically and economically. The city has seen several deadly clashes during the first quarter of 2014, yet, many of the obstacles are the result of underdevelopment and a lack of focus on the south from the central government. 

Since the revolution, Libyans have stressed that a lack of social space have been a critical issue to bringing people together and moving the nation forward. Qaddafi did not allow for many social spaces for most of his rule and Libya has never been a nation, with communities divided before and during colonialism, a weak functioning state under the kindom and divide-and-rule tactics under Qaddafi. Under the former regime, most peoplestayed in their homes---which is why most expenditures are on items for the home. So, skills like networking are limited in Libyan society an must be strengthened to build a nation. Particularly, at this time in the building of the Libyan nation, people will need to come together, and dialogue to forge a common national identity of what it means to be Libyan and what state structures will best provide for Libyan society. Therefore, regardless of the government legitimacy angle, increasing social spaces for interation and gatherings in priority communities will be an important contribution to the nation-building process.

In response to these trends, LTI is implementing clusters of visible, tangible community engagement projects that help to boost support for the political transition, bolster community security, and spark local-level change. By bringing together local authorities, civil society, and the community leaders to deliver practical projects like the establishment of community playgrounds, these activities aim to build relationships among key stakeholders and improve confidence in the transition. The projects seek to empower moderate voices to ‘Think Nationally, Act Locally,” strengthen local resiliencies that reject extremism, and promote conflict-sensitive local development.

",Supporting Salwa's Dream: A Social Activism Support Fund,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s political transition is in jeopardy. Not only are slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement, but the post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility has created an opening for extremist elements that hope to truncate Libya’s political transition and violently impose on the Libyan people a regime based on a narrow interpretation of religious law.

In May, 2014, former Libyan General Khalifa Hiftar launched a military campaign, “Operation Dignity,” against Salafi extremist groups such as Ansar al-Sharia (AAS) and their allies in and around Benghazi. The birthplace of Libya’s revolution, Benghazi had already become a symbol of the transition’s challenges, with nearly half of all recorded incidents of violence in Libya in the first quarter of 2014 occurring there. Since General Hiftar’s launch of operations targeting extremist strongholds in the Benghazhi area, the city has become even more dangerous for those who publically oppose extremism and support human rights. The most recent and prominent example of the dangers of social activism in Benghazi was the June 25th murder of nationally-respected, human rights lawyer and activist, Salwa The activity aims to support activists and causes that promote dialogue, human rights, and inclusive political processes and build their capacity to operate safely and effectively in Libya. Bugaighis was from a prominent Benghazi family, an early leader of the 2011 revolution, a former member of the National Transitional Council, a sister of Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Wafa Bugaighis, and a driving force behind the Libyan national dialogue process. At the time of her death, Bugaighis was working with LTI and the National Dialogue Preparatory Commission to develop several activities aimed at broadening public awareness of the national dialogue process.

In light of this sustained and targeted campaign of violence and intimidation against those who express support for dialogue, human rights, and inclusive political processes and opposition to extremism and violence, support is needed to ensure that these moderate voices are not silenced to the detriment of Libya’s political transition. While there has been a strong outcry against the murder of Salwa Bugaighis both in Libya and internationally, the chance to turn outrage at her murder into positive action by the majority of Libyans who want a peaceful, democratic political transition will be brief.

Recognizing the fleeting nature of this window of opportunity, this DDGS will create a flexible fund to rapidly respond to urgent requests to support activities that recognize the contributions of activists like Salwa Bugaighis, promote the visibility and security of moderate voices that advocate for dialogue and reconciliation, build an inclusive sense of national identity and national unity, and build national and international pressure against violent extremism and for political dialogue in Libya. Illustrative activities that could be implemented with the support of this fund include providing training for civil society organizations and human rights activists on how to operate in insecure environments, promoting civic engagement and activism through media campaigns highlighting the contributions of Bugaighis and other activists, and establishing a scholarship fund in Salwa Bugaighis’s name to support the development of young activists from around Libya.

Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s political transition is in jeopardy. Not only are slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement, but the post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility has created an opening for extremist elements that hope to truncate Libya’s political transition and violently impose their will on the Libyan people. The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the creation of a new General Protection Force, holding successful local government elections, and continuing the development of an inclusive National Dialogue process despite extremist attacks against civil society. There is a critical need to capitalize on these positive steps by continuing to support to these initiatives that have demonstrated a level of resilience to the chaotic political and security environment.

In January 2014, the National Dialogue Preparatory Commission (NDPC) announced the launch of a new initiative to promote reconciliation, reinforce national unity, and reinvigorate the transition through comprehensive discussions on important social, political and security issues. Although it is still in the development stage, the national dialogue process has emerged as a significant transition priority. LTI is providing technical assistance with civil society engagement, strategic communications, and other areas as requested. Since March 2014, the National Dialogue Preparatory Committee has conducted an outreach and engagement tour in 30 locations throughout Libya. In addition to testimonies collected during the engagement meetings, the NDPC distributed a four-page survey for participants to fill out. The NDPC was able to gather over 3,000 surveys from participants throughout the tour. These responses comprise an invaluable dataset that explores Libyan’s perceptions of issues such as the components of national dialogue and elements of Libyan national identity. While this survey does not contain a nationally representative sample, the sample’s distribution across all Libya’s regions provides a stratified convenience sample that will be useful in corroborating other information gathered at the NDPC’s outreach events. A professional analysis and summary of the 3,000 responses will assist the NDPC in better understanding Libyan’s perceptions of issues central to national dialogue and will help the NDPC plan more effectively for future events, programs, and outreach. It will also demonstrate to national dialogue stakeholders that the NDPC has listened to them and incorporated their input into the process.

Altai Consulting is a research and consulting firm operating in fragile and conflict-affected states in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. In Libya, Altai has partnered with a local partner, Istishari Research and Consulting, to develop a national network of field researchers, managed by a team of national and international consultants based in Tripoli. For this activity, Altai will assemble a team consisting of a project director, project manager, data entry supervisor, and a number of data entry specialists to review the handwritten surveys and enter the data from them into a custom database developed in coordination with LTI and the NDPC. Once entered, cleaned, and checked for quality, the information in the database will be used to produce an analytic report about the responses to the NDPC’s survey, as well as a short presentation in both Arabic and English with highlights from this report for LTI and the NDPC. Additionally, three Arabic language slides focused on themes of national identity, national values and a vision for Libya's future, willl be  produced for distribution through NDPC's outreach activities. 

This activity assumes that supporting the national dialogue will allow all Libyans to engage in an open and inclusive process that will promote national unity.

",Citizenship in Action! Video journals of positive Libyan role models.,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s transition is at a
crossroads. In the last weeks, violence between a myriad of militias across the country have brought Libya to the brink of civil war. This violence, combined with the slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance are creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement. Militia action is currently limiting the ability of the population to take part in normal life, and is severely hampering the nascent political processes. In spite of this, The Libyan Government is taking some positive steps forward, such as the elections of the new Council of Representatives, and ongoing constitutional drafting. There is a critical need to respond to the current violence, and capitalize on the processes which are continuing, by providing catalytic support that boosts civic activism and bolsters conflict management efforts.

Given the current crisis in Libya, programming is difficult and uncertain. While LTI continues to develop and prioritize direct project implementation, LTI is also seeking to proactively respond to this situation by strengthening its capacity for ""remote"" programming, which can be developed and implemented both inside and outside of Libya as possible, but continues to have a visible effect on the ground. This activity will respond to this need by featuring positive Libyan role models both outside and inside (as possible) of Libya, and will seek to promote the continued role that many Libyans play as citizens both inside and outside of Libya.

In order to counter the destabilizing trend of public disillusionment and lack of hope as a result of this crisis, LTI is providing catalytic support to enable civil society to effectively participate in political processes as well as creating opportunities to impact their communities through “Thinking Nationally, Act Locally” initiatives. LTI is engaging politically marginalized and conflict vulnerable groups, and build their linkages with local and national government. To promote inclusive and informed participation in key political processes, LTI is supporting initiatives that raise awareness on critical issues, create opportunities for civil society to engage with government, and empower effective advocacy.

This activity - Citizenship in Action - aims to shed a light on the importance of positive citizenship in promoting a truly civil society. It will aim to do so by showing examples of Libyan citizens being positive
members of society: facing struggles and building futures within the framework of the rule of law and a democratic and inclusive society. It will do that by exploring the lives of members of the Libyan diaspora in Europe, as well as if possible in Libya. In doing so, Citizenship in Action aims to challenge perceptions about the causes of Libya’s current situation and to explore whether it is the lack of strong state
bodies that leads to negative citizenship.

Citizenship in Action will also focus on the challenges of building a professional life and fitting into a new culture. It is hoped that it will show Libyans acting as positive members of society, respecting the rule of law, and practicing the freedoms for which we all fought. It is intended to be a positive mirror of Libyans and an inspirational one, where it is shown that where the institutions are built to promote responsible citizenship, Libyans thrive. 

The current disconnect between citizen and state is dangerous at this crucial transitional time in
Libya’s future, especially in the period leading up to the drafting of democratic Libya’s first constitution.
This disconnect was the starting point of the exploration behind this project. What makes a good citizen? The State or the Citizen? Or some essential harmony between the two? Citizenship in Action attempts to answer these questions by finding examples of active Libyan citizens in places of perceived state accountability and engagement and explore what the components of a successful formula.

By opening a window into the life of Libyans abroad, we hope to shift the conversation towards self-development and responsible citizenship. The stories will follow five Libyans abroad in different
fields, such as medicine, technology, the arts, and education. The activity will focus on their daily life, zooming into their hopes and dreams for a better personal life and for Libya. Citizenship in Action will
provide a chance to change the conversation into a more positive and forward thinking one. It is a chance to re-engage the population in a process focusing on nation building and active citizenship.

With the above methods, this project will create five short films which emphasize the positive role Libyans can play in their communities. Intaj will be responsible for the design, filming and production of all videos, which will receive content approval from OTI at the storyboard stage. Filming will take place in Europe and (if possible) in Libya, and the films will be broadcast over the internet and on TV in Libya - including potentially through regional networks currently being explored by LTI. These videos will respond to the current violence in Libya by showing the population that in spite of their voices being the loudest - those participating in the fighting are a violent minority, who do not represent the best future for Libya.

This activity assumes that by providing positive role models of Libyan citizenship, it will encourage Libyan citizens to make their voices heard and impact felt in a constructive manner through and through whatever means they can. This activity also assumes the promotion of moderate voices will continue to support Libyan activism during this troubling time for the country.

Given the current crisis in Libya, programming is difficult and uncertain. In spite of this, LTI is continuing to implement projects on the ground wherever possible, and particularly to respond to the current wave of violent conflict in Tripoli. Violence in Tripoli has led to shortages of key goods, fuel, electricity and water. In addition, there are credible reports that thousands of families who have been displaced from areas such as Qasr Ben Gashir, Hay al Akwhah, Ain Zara and Serraj. In order to counter the destabilizing trends of displacement, fighting, and public disillusionment as a result of this crisis, LTI is providing catalytic support to enable civil society to effectively participate in political processes as well as creating opportunities to impact their communities through “Thinking Nationally, Act Locally” initiatives. This activity would directly target people who have been affected by the conflict in Tripoli, working with local CSOs, Local Councils, and other actors on the ground who are able to provide access to affected communities and neighborhoods in a responsible and conflict-sensitive manner.

This DDGS will create a flexible fund to rapidly respond to urgent requests for support from civil society organization that are trying to do positive, practical things to push back against the declining security trends. LTI has received requests from organizations such as H2O, Momken, Tripoli University Students Union, and the Tripoli Local Council. Many of these organizations are already responding to the situation on the ground with activities such as food distributions, organizing gasoline queues, and youth mobilization. The crisis fund may support activities such as distribution of essential food/non-food items with the aim of stabilizing communities and preventing further violence. The fund may also support additional activities such as mapping incidents or damage, and online campaigning for affected communities or against violence and conflict. This DDGS will create a responsive mechanism and clear process so that OTI can swiftly approve an array of anticipated civil society-led activities to bolster stability in the southwest during a critical period in the Libya’s transition.

",Student Voices: Kitting-up Tripoli Student Unions to Promote Civic Engagement,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s political transition is in jeopardy. Not only are slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement, but the post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility has created an opening for extremist elements that hope to truncate Libya’s political transition and violently impose on the Libyan people a regime based on a narrow interpretation of religious law.

Starting in mid-May, there has been an escalation of conflicts and fighting throughout Libya. On May 16, 2014, an estimated 700 Benghazi Special Forces together with Khalifa Heftar forces began attacking Benghazi farms and the bases of extremists groups in support of Operation Dignity. The conflict soon spread to Derna, where there were several coordinated attacks against Ansar al-Sharia and other known extremist groups. The Operation has been supported by moderate voices in Benghazi, the east, and Libya in general. Clashes between different groups broke out in Tripoli during that same week, while smaller-scale tribal disputes broke out in the South. Although the violence in Tripoli did calm after a couple of weeks, it started up again on July 13th, when militias from Misrata, allied with Islamist brigades, attacked Zintani armed groups in and around Tripoli Airport, which has been an area controlled by Zintani militias since the end of the revolution. The fighting escalated between an alliance of Misrata affiliated militias and Zintani affiliated militias. The areas impacted have grown to include Serraj, Qasr Ben Gashir, Ain Zara, Wad Rabee, Khalat Alforjan, Salah eddin, Hay Alakwakh, ad Abu Salim - in many of these areas, residents have fled from their homes. 

Throughout this increase in conflict, the cities and surround areas of Benghazi, Tripoli and Sabha have become more dangerous for those who publically oppose extremism and support human rights, dialogue and reconciliation. LTI partners, including human rights lawyer and activist Salwa Bugaighis, and youth activist Tawfik Bensaud, have been two of many community leaders that have been tragically targeted. In light of this sustained and targeted campaign of violence and intimidation, support is needed to ensure that these moderate voices are not silenced to the detriment of Libya’s political transition.  

Nearly half of Libya’s population is made up of youth and a large proportion of those youth are in 3rd level education. Student unions’ are youth-led non-profit neutral organizations that represent students at each of the faculties under the umbrella of Tripoli University of which there are 20 unions. The boards of these unions, often elected, are comprised of active youth who are often involved in CSO activities. In the past, activities of these unions have focused on advocacy between the student populations and administration in addition to activities that have promoted political awareness, human rights and civic education. There is often a collaborative link between the unions and Tripoli-based CSO activities. For example, LTI has participated at two CSO fairs at the main campus. Recently, with Operation Dawn, the confidence of these unions has been shaken due to the politicized environment in Tripoli. This uncertainty was also recently highlighted in the kidnapping of the student union president from the Faculty of Media. 

Recognizing the fleeting nature of windows of opportunities for the unions and their members to organize and act within the university system, this activity will support the procurement of critical equipment resources to be delivered in response to future support for union activities. The intention of this material assistance is to promote the visibility of young, moderate voices that advocate for dialogue and reconciliation, build an inclusive sense of national identity and national unity, as Tripoli University itself is a microcosm of Libya with students from all around the country. Due to the fluid situation in Tripoli at the moment, this activity will be implemented by Momken, who is a strategic LTI partner who has access to the faculties and is respected among the student population.

Through funding renewals or upgrades for centers’ internet services, LTI will ensure continuity for the centers to utilize technology to collaborate with other information centers, and offer a public space for marginalized communities to access information, build their IT and related skill sets. These centers also have a significant potential role contributing to the strengthening the foundations for a sustainable peace in Libya. The managers of the centers are well experienced individuals and have become trusted activists in their communities. Supporting these actors will contribute to the civic engagement of members of these communities and their ability to work for peace and non-violence.

",Performance boost! Increasing bandwidth for LTI information centers,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s political transition is in jeopardy. Not only are slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement, but the post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility has created an opening for extremist elements that hope to truncate Libya’s political transition and violently impose on the Libyan people a regime based on a narrow interpretation of religious Law.

Starting in mid-May, there has been an escalation of conflicts and fighting throughout Libya. On May 16, 2014, an estimated 700 Benghazi Special Forces together with Khalifa Heftar forces began attacking Benghazi farms and the bases of extremists groups in support of Operation Dignity. The conflict soon spread to Derna, where there were several coordinated attacks against Ansar al-Shariah and other known extremist Groups. The Operation has been supported by moderate voices in Benghazi, the east, and Libya in general. Clashes between different groups broke out in Tripoli during that same week, while smaller-scale tribal Disputes broke out in the South. Although the violence in Tripoli did calm after a couple of weeks, it started up again on July 13th, when militias from Misurata, allied with Islamist brigades, attacked Zintani armed groups in and around Tripoli Airport, which has been an area controlled by Zintani militias since the end of The revolution. The fighting escalated between an alliance of Misrata affiliated militias and Zintani affiliated Militias. The areas impacted have grown to include Serraj, Qasr Ben Gashir, Ain Zara, Wad Rabee, Khalat Alforjan, Salah Eddin, Hay Alakwakh, ad Abu Salim - in many of these areas, residents have fled from their homes.

Over the past three years, LTI has established a network of information centers in various locations across Libya. Many of these centers have turned to hotspots in these communities where they became key partners in engaging their communities in the political process through a significant effort and hard work. Many people in these communities have turned to these centers to use the internet, looking for information related to the political processes and interact with the wider Libyan community to determine their own future by direct involvement. Furthermore, the centers have provided a variety of training to their members on topics such as computer skills (all centers), languages (Ubari), advocacy and dialogue (Ghadames). 

In addition to these trainings, the centers have launched information dissemination campaigns and workshops to promote awareness on a variety of transition – related issues such as human rights, transitional justice, elections, the role of women and youth in the transition, reconciliation, and the constitution. Recently the centers have engaged in some national dialogue initiatives and support community level conflict management initiatives. Finally, the centers managers have worked hard to develop - with the support of LTI - a network between these centers which represent different communities and geographic areas in Libya which added in building harmony and enhancing the concept of peaceful coexistence.

All of these initiatives have been boosted by these centers' role as a community hub through the provision of high-speed internet. In order to maintain and develop their position as key posts for outreach and discussion in their communities, and at the national level, LTI is seeking to continue their support in the form of a 1 year VSAT subscription. We believe particularly that a significant role will again be played by these centers in the future by increasing the civic engagement of youth and strengthening transitional political processes which will lead to strengthen foundation for a sustainable peace in Libya. The six centers which targeted are located in Bayda, Kufra2 (university), Kufra3 (Zway), Shahat, Murzuq and Yefren.

This activity assumes that by increasing access to networks and information among marginalized Libyan communities, voices for peace and non-violence will be better able to promote their cause in an informed and coordinated manner.

This activity will promote accurate and reasonable media discussion among Libyan media, and amplify the voices of civil society actors by supporting high quality content production by Rashad Foundation. The activity will provide Rashad with cameras, lenses, a computer and editing equipment to allow them to document key events and produce films which support activists and CSOs. In light of this sustained and targeted campaign of violence and intimidation against activists and media, support of this kind is especially relevant now, to ensure that these moderate voices are not silenced to the detriment of Libya’s political transition. Through the procurement of equipment, this activity will support Rashad to retain their position as a ""rapid responder"" in amplifying the voice of civil society, and contribute to the development of a healthier media environment in Libya through the delivery of well researched and accurate short films, documentaries, and PSAs.

",Amplifying Voices: Kitting-up Rashad as an Actor for Non Violence and Dialogue,"
Three years after a revolution that overthrew four decades of dictatorship, Libya’s political transition is in jeopardy. Not only are slow implementation of political milestones and weak government performance creating widespread disillusionment and disengagement, but the post-revolution proliferation of arms, militias, and volatility has created an opening for extremist elements that hope to truncate Libya’s political transition and violently impose on the Libyan people a regime based on a narrow interpretation of religious law.

Starting in mid-May, there has been an escalation of conflicts and fighting throughout Libya. On May 16, 2014, an estimated 700 Benghazi Special Forces together with Khalifa Heftar forces began attacking Benghazi farms and the bases of extremists groups in support of Operation Dignity. The conflict soon spread to Derna, where there were several coordinated attacks against Ansar al-Sharia and other known extremist groups. The Operation has been supported by moderate voices in Benghazi, the east, and Libya in general. Clashes between different groups broke out in Tripoli during that same week, while smaller-scale tribal disputes broke out in the South. Although the violence in Tripoli did calm after a couple of weeks, it started up again on July 13th, when militias from Misrata, allied with Islamist brigades, attacked Zintani armed groups in and around Tripoli Airport, which has been an area controlled by Zintani militias since the end of the revolution. The fighting escalated between an alliance of Misrata affiliated militias and Zintani affiliated militias. The areas impacted have grown to include Serraj, Qasr Ben Gashir, Ain Zara, Wad Rabee, Khalat Alforjan, Salah eddin, Hay Alakwakh, ad Abu Salim - in many of these areas, residents have fled from their homes. 

Throughout this increase in conflict, the cities and surround areas of Benghazi, Tripoli and Sabha have become more dangerous for those who publically oppose extremism and support human rights, dialogue and reconciliation. LTI partners, including human rights lawyer and activist Salwa Bugaighis, and youth activist Tawfik Bensaud, have been two of many community leaders that have been tragically targeted. In light of this sustained and targeted campaign of violence and intimidation, support is needed to ensure that these moderate voices are not silenced to the detriment of Libya’s political transition.  

Rashad Foundation has been involved in producing and making content to support both civil society and legitimate institutions since 2011. Previously they produced short videos such as ‘the curious case of the girl with no headscarf’ to highlight events at the NTC handover to the GNC, the ‘TFM family program’ during the revolution and the experiences of the war wounded in Tunisia amongst others.

However whilst Rashad were once self sufficient with filming and editing equipment, the wear and tear of the past 3 years has meant they are less agile in responding to events as required. As a result, Rashad do not currently have fully functioning editing or filming equipment. This means that rather than being able to be pro-active in helping to amplify the voices of civil society or legitimate political groups, the staff have to hunt for funds, equipment and personnel to help shoot and edit. For example, this resulted in difficulties during Rashad's last production - a long form documentary - where editing was conducted in 4 different
locations depending on whether the edit suites were unused. This cost the production more money and took Rashad roughly 2 months longer than was needed as well as adding a strain on other resources.

This activity will provide filming and editing equipment - including cameras, lenses, a computer and software - to support Rashad to retain their position as a ""rapid responder"" in amplifying the voice of civil society. The activity will contribute to the development of a healthy media environment in Libya through the delivery of well researched and accurate short films, documentaries, and PSAs. For example, Rashad were called in by a CSO partner to provide filming support for LTI's TRIP046 conference at the General National Congress in 2013; while Rashad's sister organization - Huna Productions - produced the TRIP070 ""Libyan Flavors"" PSAs which have generated a fantastic response as a result of their release.

This activity assumes that by supporting voices for non-violence and dialogue, the voice of civil society will be strengthened in it's push for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, and the emergence of legitimate political institutions.

WST001,Municipality of Tripoli Central (MTC),Cleared,2017-07-24,2018-05-31,364645.88,29715.95,"
This activity aims to increase the credibility of the Tripoli Center Municipal Council (TCMC), an elected governance institution, by providing support to its project addressing the needs of Fashloum neighborhood, a marginalized community within its jurisdiction. With LTI3 support, the TCMC will rehabilitate the Abu Dina road and conduct a public outreach campaign that highlights all its efforts to improve daily life in Fashloum.
","
IF the TCMC rehabilitates the Abu Dina Road and conducts public outreach campaign to highlight its efforts to provide services and infrastructure repairs in the Fashloum neighborhood, THEN LTI3 will contribute to preserving the credibility of democratically elected governance structures BECAUSE:
The TCMC was elected by the residents of Tripoli Center municipality to represent and serve them.
The TCMC wants to develop a positive relationship with its constituents, by engaging them in planning and decision-making processes regarding basic service delivery and infrastructure.
The Fashloum community is seeking to participate in planning and decision-making processes regarding services and infrastructure in their neighborhood.
The TCMC is actively seeking and receiving assistance from administrative bodies under the operating under the purview of the Government of National Accord. 
 


",Abu Dina Road Rehabilitation Project,"
ISSUE: Fashloum is an underdeveloped neighborhood in the Tripoli Center municipality. Many of its roads and buildings are damaged and it has a reputation as a haven for narcotics gangs. Additionally, Fashloum is perceived as being in favor of the Dignity Operation Coalition, which is counter to prevailing political sentiment in the region.  As a result, Fashloum was subject to frequent raids as anti-dignity operation militias detained some of its residents and attacked their homes causing some to flee the area.  Tensions, therefore, run high between Fashloum residents and the residents of greater Tripoli Center. To counter the stigma around Fashloum and better integrate it within the municipality, the Tripoli Center Municipal Council (TCMC) is leading a project in coordination with the Mukhtar Mahalla to bring improvements to the neighborhood through better service delivery, infrastructure refurbishment and support for community reconciliation initiatives.
In response to the TCMC's planned improvement project, 665 Fashloum residents signed a petition requesting repairs to the to Musalla and Abu Dina roads. LTI3, therefore, will provide support to the municipal council to repair the Abu Dina road. It will also support the TCMC to conduct a public outreach campaign that highlights all of its efforts to improve life in Fashloum. In particular, the campaign will highlight how the municipal council is coordinating with Libya's administrative bodies including the Housing and Infrastructure Authority to repair the Musslla road as well as the General Services Company and the Water and Sanitation Company to improve waste and waste water management. Finally, it will highlight the role of its own volunteer office and the importance of civic engagement in augmenting the work of the council.
WHY: The U.N.-led Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) singed in December 2015 seeks to safeguard a democratic transition in Libya by empowering the interim Government of National Accord (GNA) to mend Libya's political divisions and advance its recovery from the impacts of violent conflict until elections can be held.  Despite strong support from the international community, powerful spoilers especially in the East continue to challenge the GNA's role and authorities. Moreover, surveys conducted by LTI suggest a growing disdain for national-level governance across Libya as the GNA struggles to address the country's security, economic and governance challenges. It is in this context, that Libya's local-level system of governance as defined by Law No.59/2012 is taking on grater significance not only as a first-tier approach to tackling the country's development challenges, but also as a means of preserving the credibility of democratically elected governance structures.
Local-level government is the layer of government closest to the people. Therefore, LTI3 assumes that future democratic development in Libya may hinge on Libyan's initial experience with elected representatives and in particular those with whom they directly interact. A recent survey conducted by LTI reveals that Libya's municipal councils, elected in 2013/2014 to four-year terms are regarded as the country's most credible governance institutions. To help maintain this momentum, LTI seeks to provide targeted support to elected municipal councils to fulfill their role in returning a sense of normalcy and stability to the daily lives of Libyans through the establishment and management of public services. Support for elected and moderate actors will also reduce the space for extremists groups that seek to exert influence over vulnerable communities by exploiting governance gaps.
WHO/WHERE: This activity aims to support the Tripoli Center Municipal Council (TCMC) and its constituents in Tripoli's Fashloum neighborhood.
HOW/WHAT: LTI3 will support the rehabilitation of the Abu Dina road. This will involve cleaning of the repair sites, leveling the ground, installing concrete curbstone and sidewalks, as well as installation of asphalt pavement and compaction. LTI3 provide support the TCMC to conduct a public outreach campaign that highlights all of its efforts to improve life in Fashloum.

WST003,Al-Mubader Center for Development and Capacity Building,Cleared,2017-09-28,2018-03-01,87587.32,63270.99,"
This activity seeks to provide Zawiya youth with positive alternatives to violence to reduce their participation in destabilizing activities and strengthen local reconciliation initiatives.  Located in northwestern Libya, Zawiya suffers from political polarization and chronic instability. During the 2014 Dignity-Dawn conflict, Zawiya residents sided with the Dawn camp and clashed with neighboring Warshefana, which sided with the Dignity camp. Local reconciliation initiatives in 2015 resulted in an official ceasefire agreed by the rival cities and tribes and reinforced by the Libyan Political Accord. However, youth involvement in local militias threatens the sustainability of the ceasefire and hinders more durable reconciliation efforts. Most recently a conflict broke out between two rival militias which caused significant damage to the city center and claimed many lives. With USAID/OTI support, the Al-Mubader Centre, a Zawiya based NGO that has experience in conflict prevention and mediation, aims to revive an existing center owned by a local club, the Assariya Sports Club, and engage youth between the ages of 16 and 27 in a series of activities to counter youth mobilization and recruitment into militias. Al Mubader center will upgrade the existing facility with additional indoor sports games and activities and will target participation by youth who are likely to be recruited or engage in violence, as well as youth leaders who can act as positive influencers for others.
","
IF the Al-Mubader Center revives a youth center, THEN youth from rival communities will have more access to neutral spaces where they can interact and build relationships outside of rivalries and militias, BECAUSE we assume: 
​- Youth participation in violence as a result of militia recruitment is a key impediment to achieving the stability needed for longer-term reconciliation.
- A lack of opportunities to participate in positive alternatives to violence (sports, cultural events, clubs, etc.) contributes to greater participation in militia/family/tribal-based conflicts in Zawiya.
- Community and civil society buy-in and the engagement of youth 'role models' from each community will increase the participation of at-risk youth across local conflict fault lines.
-The Al-Mubader Center has sufficient access and credibility within Zawiya to be able to entice youth to participate.

",Supporting Reconciliation in Zawiya Through Youth Engagement,"
After six year of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Fragile and poorly maintained infrastructure causes major services disruptions, which, in what used to be an upper middle income country, contributes to widespread anger and perceptions of marginalization.  Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, car jacking, and clashes.  Discussion of democratic transition is now limited mostly to elites, while average citizens speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival.  The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing unrest, angst and instability from crossing a point of no return.
Zawiya is a city in northwestern Libya, situated on the Libyan coastline of the Mediterranean Sea about 45 km west of Tripoli. Zawiya is one of the biggest cities in the West, with over 300,000 residents, and the area suffers from political polarization. During the 2014 Dignity-Dawn clashes, Zawiya residents sided with the Dawn camp, led by the Misrata Islamist bloc, while Zawiya's neighbor Warshefana sided with Dignity camp, led by LNA commander Khalifa Haftar. This division led to rival factions blocking the main coastal road between Tripoli and Zawiya, which isolated the capital from the west of the country. Local reconciliation initiatives in 2015 resulted in an official ceasefire among the rival cities and tribes, and the ceasefire agreement was reinforced by the Libyan Political Accord. Zawiya also hosts Libya's largest oil refinery and the main pipeline that supplies fuel and gasoline to Tripoli. Armed groups frequently target oil facilities across Libya to press financial or political demands, and the Zawiya pipeline has experienced several temporary shutdowns due to protests by militias and oil workers.
Issue: 2017 saw progress in re-opening the Tripoli-Zawiya coastal road; however, Zawiya faces chronic instability that hinders local reconciliation initiatives. The situation in Zawiya remains tense and the ceasefire fragile, with recurring security incidents. Gang and militia alliances in Zawiya complicate matters, leading to internal conflicts that have escalated significantly in recent months and resulted in a split between the city’s families and tribes. A few months ago, fighting erupted in central Zawiya between rival groups, resulting in several casualties. The main participants in the conflict were youth from the area, who are frequently recruited by local militias, gangs and extremist groups that take advantage of their youth, indigence, and the political polarization between competing alliances.
Why: Now that clashes have paused, the community in Zawiya recognizes the need for more constructive options for youth engagement in the city as they look forward to more serious reconciliation efforts and a sustainable truce.  
Who/where: To address the issue of youth mobilization and participation in destabilizing activities, civil society actors in Zawiya are attempting to provide youth from rival tribes and families in the city with peaceful alternatives to violence and constructive space to reconnect with each other. Al-Mubader Center is a well-established group based in Zawiya, an LTI 2 grantee under TIP006. Under LTI2, Al Mubader center succeeded in implementing several activities aimed at promoting youth participation and empowerment. Al-Mubader is one of the few organizations that has experience in conflict management, mediation and conflict prevention. It has played a vital role in many peace initiatives not only in Zawiya but across the western region. In June 2017 an armed conflict broke out in the center of Zawiya between two rival militias (Hanish militia an Khadrawi militia) which caused significant damage to the city center and claimed many lives. Al-Mubader organization played a key role in the mediation process alongside the Zawiya elders committee to bring about a ceasefire which then extended to a peace agreement. In addition, Al-Mubader organization facilitated dialogue sessions between the two rival groups during the same month to support the peace agreement and ease tension between both sides of the conflict.
What/how:With support from USAID/OTI, Al-Mubader Center aims to revive an existing center owned by a local club, the Assariya Sports Club, and engage youth between the ages of 16 and 27 in constructive activities. Assariya Sports Club operates a center that is located between the rival neighborhoods and is thus accessible to youth from both communities.The club is the second biggest soccer club in Zawiya where youth gather on weekly basis.  The grantee will recruit youth participants from all Zawiya’s neighborhoods and through Al Mubader and Assariya Sports Club’s networks. The grantee will target youth activists and representatives from those rival neighborhoods who can act as influencers for other youth and engage them in the planning/preparations/discussion stages of the opening, competitions and activities that will take place in the youth center. The center will provide a platform for youth from rival communities to reestablish relationships and interact in a neutral environment. The grantee and LTI will also leverage this space for future reconciliation activities. Al Mubader center will upgrade the existing facility with additional indoor sports games and activities including chess, table tennis, snooker, coffee shop and a library. By supporting this activity, LTI will be laying the groundwork for further engagement in Zawiya in the aimed at supporting local reconciliation initiatives.

WST004,Abu Salim Municipal Council,Cleared,2017-09-27,2018-03-31,286822.47,46690.87,"
This activity seeks to help the Abu Salim Municipal Council (MC) in Tripoli demonstrate its commitment to addressing citizen priorities by supporting the council to improve the quality of schools in a strategic district in Libya's capital. The municipality has more school-aged children that it can accommodate in existing schools due tothe volume of IDPs that have fled to Tripoli from conflict affected areas ofLibya. Additionally, recent clashes in Tripoli damaged many of the city's school buildings, exacerbating already poor conditions in those facilities. Abu Salim residents have identified basic public education as a key community priority through a series of town hall meetings held by the Municipal Council - some of which were previously supported by LTI 2.LTI 3 will help the Abu Salim MC, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education, to refurbish 12 overcrowded and poorly maintained schools prior to the start of the new school year in fall 2017. In addition, LTI 3 will support a public outreach campaign and opening ceremonies in refurbished schools to highlight efforts to improve the schools and demonstrate the council's commitment to addressing citizen priorities. .This project will help demonstrate the ability of an inclusive, representative governance body (the Municipal Council) to effectively respond to a community priority.
","
IF Abu Salim Municipal Council repairs and refurbishes 12 schools, THEN residents will be more aware of the council's efforts to address community priorities, because:
- Improvement in the education sector is a top priority for residents, as expressed to the MC in previous consultation meetings.
- The Abu Salim Municipal Council and Ministry of Education want to rehabilitate the schools and increase attendance, but are limited by resources.
- Inability to enroll children in schools in the upcoming academic year will increase local frustration and further jeopardize the MC's standing, opening up opportunities for expansion of LNA influence in the West. 
-Face-to-face outreach efforts by the MC during activity implementation in addition to the large number of direct and indirect beneficiaries will signal MC efforts to engage community members and ensure wide recognition of the MC's role.
",Abu Salim Schools Maintenance,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Fragile and poorly maintained infrastructure causes major services disruptions, which, in what used to be an upper middle income country, contributes to widespread anger and perceptions of marginalization.  Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, car jacking, and clashes.  Discussion of democratic transition is now limited mostly to elites, while average citizens speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival.  The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing unrest, angst and instability from crossing a point of no return.
The December 2015 signing of the U.N.-backed Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) and its creation of a Government of National Accord (GNA) raised popular optimism and hope in Libya. However, by 2017 approval ratings of the GNA have reached an all-time low.  The GNA’s failure to provide security, deliver basic services, and manage the cash liquidity crisis has destroyed confidence in its ability to govern, and the governance vacuum has forced citizens to rely heavily on municipal councils to provide basic services and address other critical needs. Municipal councils are the only remaining elected bodies in Libya whose mandates haven't expired, and most enjoy higher levels of legitimacy than national level bodies. However, their limited resources and technical capacity often undermine their efforts to address citizen priorities. Economic hardship and lack of services in Western Libya contribute to the perception that things are better in the east, where Libyan National Army commander Khalifa Haftar at least provides security. While direct confrontation between GNA and LNA forces is unlikely due to a recent ceasefire agreement between Prime Minister Fayez Serraj and General Haftar, lack of services in the west contribute to widespread resentment of the GNA and municipal councils that fall under its jurisdiction. The failure of the GNA and municipal councils to address citizen priorities even in Tripoli is particularly worrisome amid recent attempts from LNA expand its influence in Western Libya.
Issue: Abu Salim is a low-income area that is also one of the largest municipalities in Tripoli with over 400,000 residents. Since 2014, Abu Salim witnessed five major military conflicts mainly between rival militias causing significant damage to public facilities including educational institutions. In addition to the infrastructure degradation, Abu Salim has received a large number of IDPs from across the country. As a result of the damage and rapid increase in the population, the Abu Salim Municipal Council has been unable to maintain its schools and cope with the number of students. Currently, local authorities are struggling to respond to the urgent needs of these schools before the start of new school year in fall 2017.
Why: The Ministry of Education has failed to respond to requests from the Abu Salim Municipality for assistance to maintain its schools. Given the falling popularity of Tripoli's elected municipal councils and the imminent threat that LNA loyalists pose to western cities, there is a need  to support Tripoli's municipal councils to effectively respond to a community priorities The need for school maintenance has been raised through a series of town hall meetings held by the Municipal Council - some of which were previously supported by LTI 2 under its strategic communications cluster and TIP058 activity.   
Who/Where: This activity will target students and their families (residents and IDPs) in Abu Salim, a heavily populated municipality in the capital.This activity will also support representative institutions that are expected to address community needs: Abu Salim Municipal Council (direct), and the Ministry of Education (indirect). The schools are located throughout the municipality and refurbishments will aim to allow increased enrollment for school-age children in every neighborhood in the district.
How/What: 
LTI 3 will provide basic equipment and support rehabilitation for the 12 selected schools (restroom materials, painting, windows, electrical accessories and educational equipment including student’s desks, white boards, and stationary). In consultation with the municipality,, the following schools were prioritized: 1) Taqraft; 2) Ain Jaloot; 3) Ali Ennajar; 4) Hadhba Secondary school; 5) Majd Al-Arab; 6) Hay Dimashq; 7) Al-Islah; 8) Ashabab; 9) Alnajem Assatei; 10) Shams Almaerifa; 11) Ahrar Libya; 12) Alhorreya Secondary school
Approximately 6,500 students currently attend the target schools (based on numbers from the educational registry office in Abu Salim). A joint committee of local and national authorities choose 12 of the district's 80 schools based on the severity of need for maintenance work. Repairs and refurbishments will increase the capacity of target schools by increasing the number of functional classrooms so they can accept additional students and ease overcrowding in currently functional classrooms, some of which host up to 55 students at a time. LTI 3 will also provide support to the MC to conduct a public outreach about the activityin order to increase awareness among citizens that the council is attempting to address community priorities.

WST005,Abu Salim Municipal Council,Cleared,2017-08-28,2018-02-28,81723.2,16681.02,"
This activity aims to increase public confidence in Abu Salim Municipal Council's ability to address critical service delivery needs in cooperation with relevant national government institutions. Specifically, this project  aims to increase confidence among residents of Kashouni, Al-Jebs, and Mothalet Al-Rabesh neighborhoods, In order to achieve this objective, LTI3 will provide Abu Salim Municipal Council with new sewage equipment and accessories for these three neighborhoods in cooperation with the Public Water and Sanitation Company, which is under the GNA General Authority for Water Resources. The Public Water and Sanitation Company and the municipal council will be responsible for all installation and maintenance. Wastewater and sewage flooding in Kashouni, Al-Jebs and Mothalet Al-Rabesh areas in Abu Salim is a highly visible public problem, which often floods streets and leads to potential public health problems. According to the municipal council’s environmental sanitation office, failure to replace equipment such as pipelines, sewage manholes, pumps, valves, cables, etc will result in the contamination of groundwater and long-term health and environmental issues. Kashouni, Al-Jebs and Mothalet Al-Rabesh are also the most densely populated areas in Abu Salim which host 50,000 residents. In addition to more than 1000 IDPs from different cities which causes more pressure on the public utilities. These areas has also the most damaged drainage system in Abu Salim. The drainage broken pipelines in addition to causing contamination of groundwater it has also damaged the underground electricity cables and polluted residents drinking water. In order to amplify the project’s impact and strengthen residents' confidence in the council, the project will include a video showing the before and after effects. In addition, the council will hold a town-hall meeting at the beginning of the project to discuss the new improvements the council is implementing in cooperation with the Public Water Company to gain residents support during implementation. This activity is an opportunity for Abu Salim Municipal Council to provide critical basic services benefiting a large segment of the population and showcase for citizen’s collaboration between national level government institutions and the council. These efforts will strengthen residents’ confidence in the council in the target three neighborhoods.
","
if Abu Salim Municipal Council installs new sewage equipment in Abu Slim in cooperation with the Public Water and Sanitation Company will have increased confidence in Abu Salim Municipal Council's efforts to address critical service delivery priorities in cooperation with relevant national government institutions because:
1-We assume that the Abu Salim MC wants to deliver critical services to their community and wants to build a relationship with their residents,but lack of resources.
2-The installation of new equipment in the sewage network is a highly visible, tangible project that will benefit the entire community in these 3 neighborhoods and that all residents will recognize and appreciate.
3-The project is a critical priority for residents in these areas, as the problems in the current sewage network often create flooding in the streets and generate potential public health problems.
4- Residents already have a baseline level of awareness about the MC's activities and this project will contribute to increasing confidence in the MC
5-Increasing resident awareness of MC efforts to address critical needs will be possible because LTI research on public attribution of service delivery indicates a combination of services plus outreach yields the strongest outcomes..
6- Coordination with national authorities is needed to guarantee successful implementation of the activity.. 
",Wastewater Improvements in Abu Salim,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Fragile and poorly maintained infrastructure causes major services disruptions, which, in what used to be an upper middle income country, contributes to widespread anger and perceptions of marginalization. Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, car jacking, and clashes. Discussion of democratic transition is now limited mostly to elites, while average citizens speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival. The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing unrest, angst and instability from crossing a point of no return. 
Issue: Abu Salim is a low-income area that is one of the largest municipalities in Tripoli with over 400,000 residents. Since 2014, Abu Salim has witnessed five major military conflicts between rival militias causing significant damage to public facilities and infrastructure degradation. In addition to the infrastructure damage from the fighting, Abu Salim has received a large number of IDPs from across the country, placing further strain on its aging infrastructure. As a result of the damage and rapid increase in the population, sewage and rainwater often flood the streets, contaminating water and contributing to increased health problems of residents. With very limited financial resources, the Municipal Council has been unable to frequently coordinate with the Public Water and Sanitation company to provide temporary solutions and aims to continue this coordination to solve the problem permanently. In Tripoli, The Public Water and Sanitation Company is a national level authority that is subordinated to the General Authority for Water Resources of the GNA.
Why:
It is important for LTI3 to build the public’s confidence in the MC by providing a tangible and highly visible service. Sewage water is one of the most critical issue facing the Abu Salim MC, therefore supporting the MC and the Public Water and Sanitation Company to address this community priority will empower both local and national authorities in the eyes of the residents in Abu Salim. It will also boost the legitimacy and credibility of Abu Salim MC and the Public Water and Sanitation Company against other spoilers in general who are trying to take advantage of the vaccum caused by five military conflicts during the last year mainly between forces loyal to Ghawil government (salvation government) and al-Sarraj government (The Government of National Accord).
Who/Where: The Municipal Council was elected in 2014 and consists of 9 Council members (1 female) and 60 Abu Salim Council employees (20 female).
How/What: In this activity, LTI 3 will provide Abu Salim MC with materials to address the highly visible problem of waste water and sewage flooding in Al-Kashouni, Al-Jebs, and Mothalet Al-Rabesh areas. These three areas host an estimated 50,000 residents. Kashouni, Al-Jebs, and Mothalet Al-Rabesh neighborhoods are the most densely populated areas in Abu Salim which host 50,000 residents. In addition to more than 1,000 IDPs from different cities which causes more pressure on the public utilities. These areas have also the most damaged drainage system in Abu Salim. The drainage broken pipelines caused contamination of groundwater in addition to damaging the electricity cables and polluted the resident’s drinking water. LTI 3 will purchase sewage pumps, pipes, valves, and other accessories for the three major neighborhoods in cooperation with the Public Water and Sanitation Company. LTI 3 will support the council to design and print flyers to educate residents about the project and the role of citizens in helping maintain local utilities. The MC will also produce a video showcasing service projects implemented under the “Our Shared Responsibility” campaign. In addition, the MC will hold a town-hall meeting at the beginning of the project to inform citizens about the MC’s efforts in cooperation with the Public Water Company to gain residents’ support during implementation.
This activity complements TIP057 LTI2 activity, due to unavailability of some essential equipment in LTI2 the grant was moved to LTI3 for implementation completion. This activity will be an opportunity for Abu Salim MC to resolve a highly visible, priority public service problem and inform citizens about collaboration between national and local authorities to address it.

WST007,Gharyan Municipal Council,Cleared,2017-11-15,2018-04-23,484293.45,0,"
This activity seeks to enable the Gharyan Municipal Council to demonstrate gains to their community. Residents of Gharyan and the neighboring cities suffer from severe water shortages caused by years of conflict and neglected maintenance. LTI3 will provide pumps and outreach support to enable the Gharyan MC to increase the water supply from 20 existing ground wells and conduct an awareness campaign highlighting the MC’s collaboration with national water authorities to address the shortage issue. The MC will use a variety of outreach tools including a stakeholders’ meeting, media outlets and social media. This activity will contribute to public confidence in inclusive, representative governance bodies. 
","
IF: Gharyan MC increases the water supply at 20 existing wells,

THEN: Residents in Gharyan have increased awareness of the Gharyan Municipal Council’s responsiveness to the ongoing water shortage.

BECAUSE: 

1. Addressing the water problem is strategic given its importance and high visibility. 

2. An outreach component will amplify the MC’s efforts to be responsive.




",Gharyan Wells Rehabilitation,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration.  Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, carjacking, and clashes.  Discussion of democratic transition is now limited mostly to elites, while average citizens speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival.  The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing unrest, angst and instability from crossing a point of no return. 
Gharyan city is the biggest city in the Nafusa Mountains with over 200,000 residents. The city is the administrative capital for the mountain region and straddles a strategic mountain road, some 90 km south of Tripoli. In 2014, the Nafusa Mountains witnessed major military conflicts between rival militias and tribes causing significant damage to public facilities and infrastructure, especially in Gharyan. The damage has compounded resource availability in this water-scarce region, where prices for water trucks are the highest in the country. The man-made river which is in Gharyan and provides water for the whole region, is only supplying 20% of the total water needs. With very limited financial resources, the Municipal Council (MC) has been unable to implement an alternative plan that includes equipping existing artesian wells with pumps and provide temporary solutions to water shortages. This has put the MC under pressure to provide fair access to water to the region’s various communities.
It is important for LTI3 to build the public’s confidence in the MC by providing a tangible and highly visible service. Water is one of the most critical issue facing the Gharyan MC, therefore supporting the MC and the Public Water and Sanitation Company to address this community priority will empower both local and national authorities in the eyes of the residents of the western mountain. It will also boost the legitimacy and credibility of state institutions like the Gharyan MC and the Public Water and Sanitation Company against spoilers. In particular, Gharyan has had a large support base for Fajr Libya actors, who occasionally attempt to destabilize the GNA. In October 2017, Gharyan also hosted Basit Igtet, a political personality who is calling for demonstrations and threatening to form yet another government. 
With support from USAID/OTI, Gharyan MC will equip 20 existing wells with pumps to increase the water supply. Those wells were selected based on a set of criteria including well location, number of beneficiaries, need, and community leaders (Makhatir Mahalla). LTI 3 will procure the pumps, and the MC will be responsible for installation. LTI3 will support the Gharyan MC in organizing an outreach meeting that aims to promote the local authorities' efforts to address Gharyan area residents' water needs. The event will be attended by representatives of the local community, community leaders (Makhatir Mahalla), officials from the water resources authority, Gharyan MC members, and members of the media. Gharyan MC will use social media and local radio shows to promote the activity and highlight their efforts in responding to this urgent community priority. This activity will contribute to public confidence in inclusive, representative governance bodies.

WST008,Ain Zara MC,Cleared,2018-01-28,2018-05-31,232708.18,0,"
This activity seeks to increase Ain Zara residents' awareness of the Ain Zara Municipal Council (AZMC) efforts to address critical community needs by supporting the municipal council to improve road safety around schools. Ain Zara area is a gateway to Tripoli in western Libya and has witnessed a year long conflict between GNC (General National Congress) and GNA-aligned forces. The city has consequently become a safe haven for militias. Given the absence of the rule of law, Ain Zara local authorities fear that spoilers (GNC loyalists, LNA, or extremist groups…etc.) would exploit the gaps in governance and use the city as a launching pad to take control over the capital. The MC has identified road safety as a priority need especially in front of school as evidenced by the high rates of school children involved in traffic accidents. LTI3 will support the AZMC to improve road safety around 39 schools by installing speed bumps and road signs. The MC will also partner with a local NGO, the Libyan society for traffic safety to organize awareness sessions on traffic safety for school staff as well as for children to amplify the impact of the project and draw attention to the AZMC's efforts to address the community's priorities. 
","
IF: If  Ain Zara Municipal Council improves road safety in school zones,
THEN: Ain Zara residents’ perception of the MC’s efforts to address their needs will improve. 
BECAUSE:
• School zones are frequented areas in the city where MC efforts will be highly visible and appreciated.
• Ain Zara municipality wants to improve the traffic safety and build a relationship with the local community, but they lack the resources
• In addition to getting to residents through the feedback of their children, combination of face to face outreach and media/social media promotion will give the MC an opportunity to connect directly with citizens. 
• Improving safety of children/students is a shared and high priority among families of Ain Zara. 
",Improving Ain Zara Traffic Safety,"
In December 2015, the U.N.-backed Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) was signed, creating the Government of National Accord (GNA); which raised popular optimism and hope. However, by 2017 approval ratings of the GNA have reached an all-time low. The GNA’s failure to provide security, deliver basic services, and manage the cash liquidity, electricity and other crises has destroyed confidence in its ability to govern, forcing citizens to expect municipal councils to provide basic services and address other critical needs. Municipal councils are the only remaining elected bodies in Libya whose mandates haven't expired, and have higher levels of legitimacy than other national bodies. However, their limited resources and technical capacity often undermine their efforts to address citizen priorities.

Economic hardship and lack of services in Western Libya contribute to the perception that things are better in the east, where Libyan National Army commander Khalifa Haftar at least provides security. While direct confrontation between GNA and LNA forces unlikely due to a recent ceasefire agreement between Prime Minister Fayez Serraj and General Haftar, lack of services in the west contribute to widespread resentment of the GNA and municipal councils that fall under its jurisdiction. The failure of the GNA and municipal councils to address citizen priorities even in Tripoli is particularly worrisome amid recent attempts from LNA expand its influence in Western Libya.

WHO/WHERE: Ain Zara area is a gateway to the capital, located to Tripoli’s southeast. Following a year of conflict between GNC (General National Congress) and GNA-aligned forces, Ain Zara has become a safe haven for militias. Given the absence of the rule of law, Ain Zara local authorities fear that spoilers (GNC loyalists, LNA, or extremist groups…etc.) would exploit the gaps in governance and use the city as a launching pad to take control over the capital. The elected Ain Zara municipality is the newest in Tripoli and struggles to assert itself as a local authority due to lack of experience, capacity and resources to address local issues.

ISSUE: One of the most pressing issues for the municipality is poor infrastructure and the inability to keep pace with population growth in the area. Poor urban planning and traffic enforcement is one example. Ain Zara has seen an increase in traffic accidents in the last year and now has the highest rate of traffic deaths in Tripoli. Especially noticed by the community is the very high rate of school children involved in traffic accidents, despite the relatively small number of schools in Ain Zara. Residents have demanded that the municipality intervene to improve traffic safety for their children.

HOW: With support from USAID/OTI, the Ain Zara Municipal Council (AZMC) will closely coordinate with the Traffic Police, Authority of Roads and Bridges and Ain Zara office of Education and the Libyan society for traffic safety to address the road safety problem. AZMC will form a committee engaging the aforementioned entities to implement a campaign aimed at improving road safety for school children in all fundamental education schools (primary, secondary and high schools) in the municipality (40 schools). The campaign includes road safety improvements (installing road signs, Zebra crossings and speed bumps) near schools and conducting an awareness campaign to educate school children and school staff about road safely. LTI3 will support a public awareness campaign including outreach meetings, media outlets, outreach material and school’s visits to highlight the AZMC’s efforts to improve the traffic safety conditions and demonstrate the council's commitment to addressing citizen priorities. This activity will help demonstrate the ability of an inclusive, representative governance body (the Municipal Council) to effectively respond to a community priority.

WST014,n/a,Cleared,2018-02-15,2018-04-15,244050.63,0,"
This activity seeks to contribute to LTI efforts to support reconciliation initiatives by providing food commodities relief and essentials to IDPs on the move back to Tawergha. During the 2011 revolution, residents of Tawergha sided with Gaddafi and were forced by the Misratans to leave their town. In early 2018, the Government of National Accord (GNA) announced February 1, 2018, as a “date of return” for the Tawerga IDPs. Seizing the momentum, thousands of IDPs set out in convoys to Tawergha but were prevented from entering the town by the Misrata military council and Al Bunyan Al Marsous. Unable to continue their journey, IDPs set up makeshift camps in  Gararat, an area located near Bani Walid, where they lack provisions and basic services. Given the increasing demand for relief essentials, LTI will provide food commodities and other relief supplies to IDPs on the move back to Tawergha. This assistance will be through Direct Distribution of Goods and Services since the situation changes on a daily basis, requiring a flexible assistance mechanism to keep pace. This tool is also the most appropriate given the multitude of actors on the ground. To deliver the assistance, LTI will work with local entities who are neutral, have access to the IDPs, and are accepted by both the host communities and the Tawerghans.
","
If LTI3 provides Tawergha IDP’s with food commodity and essentials,
THEN: emergency relief needs of Tawergha IDPs in temporary settlements will be met. 
BECAUSE:
- LTI is well positioned to provide quick and flexible response, which is necessary given swiftly changing conditions on the ground 
- Meeting urgent food and basic health services will be sufficient in the near term, while a flexible mechanism will allow LTI to follow up with other needs 
- Security in and around the camp remains permissive for access and delivery during the next three months 


",Emergency Response to Tawerga IDPs,"
After six years of chronic instability and a persistent governance and security vacuum, Libyans increasingly frame their aspirations in terms of survival and preventing further deterioration. Average citizens are confined to ever smaller cantons to avoid kidnapping, carjacking, and clashes, and they now speak in terms of securing basic services, ensuring minimal security, and financial survival rather than democratic transition. The country context has shifted from one of potentially positive transition to one that is sliding toward irreparable collapse. National reconciliation and political transition will only be possible if the country is able to prevent growing angst and instability from crossing a point of no return.
The town of Tawergha sided with Ghaddafi in the 2011 uprising. Revolutionaries from nearby Misrata accused Tawergha of committing atrocities against them, and in an act of retribution Misratans attacked Tawergha, forcing its 38,000 residents to scatter across Libya to find refuge. Unlike most of Libya’s IDPs who take up residence in private homes, the majority of Tawergha live under poorer economic circumstances in IDP camps. As for the town of Tawergha, it lies decimated and deserted. According to LibMAC, the level of UXO contamination is even worse than Sirte.
The Government of National Accord (GNA) blessed a reconciliation agreement between the Misrata MC and Tawergha. Despite the Misratan Mayor Eshtewi’s subsequent assassination, the GNA moved forward with announcing a “date of return” for February 1, 2018. Seizing the momentum, thousands of IDPs set out in convoys to Tawergha. At the time of writing, no one has returned. In the West, militias aligned with the Misrata Military Council are preventing returnee movement beyond just outside Bani Walid. From the East, GNA-aligned Misratan forces (ABAM) are preventing convoys from even reaching Sirte. Their plight has caught media attention both within and outside Libya. The numbers of IDPs attempting to return is expected to swell in late February when schools let out for their two week break in between semesters.
IDPs caught in the balance lack provisions and basic services. Humanitarian organizations like UNHCR are providing emergency relief such as blankets and household items. LTI is well positioned to respond quickly with food commodity baskets, and can follow up with other necessary items. The Tawergha Local Council, Bani Walid Local Council, and Harawa Municipal Council have formed local crisis committees to oversee the displacement in their areas. The IDPs have also formed committees (one in Harawa and one in Gararat) to coordinate the mobilization of people and manage the camps.
LTI will provide food commodities and other relief essentials to IDPs on the move back to Tawergha. This assistance will  be a DDGS, as the situation changes on a daily basis, requiring a flexible assistance mechanism to keep pace. This tool is also the most appropriate given the multitude of actors on the ground. To deliver the assistance, LTI will work with local entities who are neutral, have access to the IDPs, and are accepted by both the host communities and the Tawerghans. This timely assistance will contribute to LTI efforts to reinforce reconciliation initiatives.
